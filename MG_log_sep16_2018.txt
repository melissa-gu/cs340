Mapping introspection's blind spot: Reconstruction of dual-task phenomenology
using quantified introspection
 
o Overview of the experiment:
- The authors performed a psychological refractory experiment, comparing
 objective responses to the subjective, introspective responses of the subjects
   + They found introspections to be highly correlated with objective measures
   + However, whenever the second target was presented while the first task
     was being completed, subjects were largely unaware of them: this was the
     psychological refractory period effect
 
o Figure Three:
- (A) Representation of the central bottleneck model
   + While the central stage of T1 is occurring, T2 processing cannot occur
   + The central stage of T2 begins at the end of T1 decision no matter when
     T2 onset occurs
   MG> It looks like the so-called "bottleneck" is that only one thing may be
       in the central stage at once. One thing I don't understand is how, if T1
       and T2 are perceived/onset at the same time, the brain determines
       whether T1 or T2 is processed (via the Central stage) first
- (B) Objective response times as a function of SOA
   + SOA is stimulus onset asynchrony, or the amount of time between the
     starts of stimuli
   + As the SOA increases, the reaction time seems to decrease
   MG> This makes sense in light of (A). When the SOA is very small, it's
       likely that the central stage of T1 is still occurring, and thus the
       reaction time for T2 would be longer
- (C) Subjective phenomenology of a PRP trial based on introspective measures
   + PRP: psychological refractory period (time during which the response to
     a second stimulus is significantly slowed because a first stimulus is
     still being processed.)
   + In most cases, the objective SOA matches what participants reported.
     Participants seemed blind to T2's onset during processing of T1 
   MG> When comparing (C) to (A), it's easy to see the PRP. Even when the SOA
       was 0, the participants seemed to think T2 appeared much after T1. This
       shows very clearly the idea that our brains are like a bottleneck, only
       able to process one thing at a time

o Methods:
    - First, had subjects undergo "calibration" which entailed responding to a 
      tone and estimating timing repeatedly
    - Then had subjects respond as quickly as possible to an auditory tone (T1) 
      by pressing one of two keys corresponding with a low tone and a high tone, 
      followed by a visual letter (T2) by pressing one of two keys corresponding 
      with one of two possible letters
        + The subjects were told to respond first to the tone, then to the
          letter (this answers my question from last week about how they 
          were to differentiate which was T1 and T2 and which to process first)
        + Subjects then had to answer four introspective question regarding:
            - Time to respond to T1 (auditory tone)
            - Time to respond to T2 (visual stimulus)
            - Stimulus onset asynchrony
            - Whether the letter appeared before or after the auditory decision

o Overall Conclusions:
    - With regards to the objective measures, the experiments demonstrated all 
      of the properties of the PRP phenomenon, meaning at short SOAs, processing 
      of T1 delayed processing of T2
    - Subjectively, subjects underreported reaction times, suggesting they 
      introspect about only part of the total processing time
        + Subjects showed an inability to introspect about the T2 duration
          when occupied with the first
    - The authors also conclude that introspection is a tool that can provide 
      data about the subjective phenomenology of a task, whether or not it is 
      objectively true
o Does this study conflict with the concept of attentional blink?
    - Marti et al. describe the dual-task paradigm as something allowing us to
      monopolize our attention on a task, leaving other tasks with few 
      attentional resources, to the point where perception is delayed and the
      subjective timing is off.
    - Attentional blink (AB) occurs when the perception of the second target does 
      not occur at all when the two target onsets are very close
        + This might seem to conflict with the results of this study, where it 
          appears that subjects merely experienced a delay in CON, but they 
          did perceive the second target
    - Marti et al., however, decide that the central interference model and the 
      attentional blink model do not conflict, but are in fact related.
        + AB can occur under appropriate conditions for masking, leading not 
          just to delayed perception but an inability to achieve CON at all. 
        + The conditions necessary for this to occur when the targets are
          embedded in a temporal series of distractors.
            - Some reports have shown that distractors that occur after the 
              onset of T2 can cause the distortion of perception
        + Some have even said that the PRP (psychological refractory period) 
          and AB models should be combined into one
    MG> It seems that most researchers agree that attentional blink and the
    models/findings of this paper are not conflicting, but in fact share many
    commonalities. My conclusion is that this study did not create the 
    appropriate conditions for the AB phenomenon to occur, namely using
    distractors both before and after T2.

o Why is the personal pronoun “I” ambiguous in situations when we are sure of 
  the identity of the person using that pronoun?
  MG> I'm still a little confused about this question in the context of the 
      paper. The paper seems to conclude that one's introspective reports, while
      not necessarily always objectively true, can reveal things about what is
      going on in the mind. Perhaps when a person uses the word "I" and is
      reflecting introspectively, they aren't actually reporting on their actual
      state but rather, what they think their state is?

Introduction
 
o Discusses prehistoric depictions of dreaming, and the recurring symbolic
  use of birds as representations of souls flying away from physical bodies
  - Dreaming potentially is proof that mental activity is more than the
    physical world
    + The author wonders-how can a mind, which is "free-flying", arise from
      a down to earth, or material brain?
 
Descarte's Challenge
 
o Descartes described dualism-the idea that the conscious mind is made of
  nonmaterial substance, and eludes the laws of physics, that no machine could
  ever emulate the free flowing mind
  -   Many people, textbooks, etc. believe that Descartes set back neuroscience
  -   The author argues that the "truth" is Descartes was a pioneer, and his
      ideas were the first in synthetic biology and theoretical modeling
 
o Descartes described the human body as a machine-similar to an instrument,
  with pipes and fluids called "animal spirits".  This machine has functions
  such as digestion, nourishment, hear beating, waking, sleeping, smell,
  light detection, as well as impression of ideas in "the organ of common
  sense and imagination", and the retention of ideas in memory, and the
  functioning is similar to/as natural as a clock's ticking or some sort of
  mechanical system.
  MG> I find it fascinating to see the contrast between how insightful
      some of his ideas are (such as memories being pathways, which is
      reminiscent of modern ideas about changes in brain connections and
      neurons) and how absurd others are (like the often referenced
      "animal spirits" which can be a mechanism in moving a limb or, when the
      pressure of spirits is reduced, causing sleep)
 
o Although (as described above) Descartes did believe the mind (or some
  functions of the mind) to be part of the bodily machine, he still believed
  that some portion of it was immaterial. Two of its functions made him
  particularly believe minds to be something no machine could ever replicate:
  - Expressing thoughts/ideas through words, and responding to queries
  MG> This is really interesting, because it seems like a lot of
      the latest technology (e.g. Amazon echo, Google Assistant, etc.) is
      able to "understand" and respond quite appropriately to human speech. I
      recently saw a video about something called Google Duplex, during which
      the assistant made a call to book a haircut appointment, which was
      astonishing to watch, but raised a lot of questions about potential
      implications of such realistic AI.  It's strange to think about what
      Descartes would think about a machine replicating human interaction so
      accurately.
   - Flexible reasoning-Descartes believed machines behave rigidly, and
     cannot generate infinite variety of thoughts/react to any possible
     occurrence in life
 
The Last Problem
 
o While far away galaxies and tiny particles have been studied extensively,
  the brain and consciousness have not
o In the 80s, the word was even "banned" - psychologists felt it added little
  - This book tells the story about how this attitude changed, and
    consciousness became a focus of neuroscience
 
Cracking Consciousness
 
o Definition of consciousness- 3 parts:
  - State of wakefulness
  - Focusing attention onto specific things
  - Conscious access (hereby abbreviated as CON)
    + The fact that some information enters our mind and awareness and
      becomes transferable to others
 
o Author argues that only CON is true consciousness, as one can see something
  flash before their eyes but not really process/see it (this is unconscious)
 
o CON can be studied scientifically-the author says there are "dozens of ways"
  stimuli can be perceived.
  MG> I wish the author would provide more information about how
      these stimuli are studied. In the next paragraph he details that
      higher-order consciousness (like the recursive nature of consciousness)
      can now be quantified, but doesn't discuss how. Although perhaps he
      will cover this more later.
 
o Some philosophers [AC: especially David Chalmers] claim consciousness and
  the way we perceive our world will never be described scientifically, but
  the author disagrees.
 
To See or Not to See
 
o The eye takes in a lot of things, but only some things make it to our minds,
  whereas others are lost (this is CON).
 
Turning Subjectivity into Science
 
o The author argues that subjective reports from patients are important in the
  study of CON as they correspond with real events in the brain.
 
Signatures of Conscious Thoughts
 
o Author's research uses brain scans to examine where in the brain is
  stimulated when a person perceives something.
  - He and colleagues have proposed "global neuronal workspace" -
    consciousness is sort of broadcast throughout a neuronal network
    throughout the brain.
    + This network is not traditional in the sense that it is active only when
      stimulated by some sort of input, but instead even in the dark, it
      remains active, broadcasting information throughout, causing the stream
      of consciousness.
 
The Future of Consciousness
 
o Applications of such research include determining whether patients in comas
  are conscious and simply unable to communicate that to us.
  - As well, could we replicate consciousness using computers?
    MG> I would love to learn more about new technologies such as AI and
        machine learning which attempt to model certain components of
        consciousness, especially as these topics are currently a "hot topic"
        of the technology industry.
Chapter 1: Consciousness Enters the Lab
 
o Optical illusions (such as the one on page 18) can allow researchers to
  track neural pathways during conscious vs unconscious stimuli, as right
  before our eyes things can disappear and reappear.
 
The Many Facets of Consciousness
 
o Even though we are constantly receiving endless stimuli -- colors, sounds,
  objects across the room -- only one single thread of consciousness is
  present in our brains. Our consciousness filters out all the extraneous
  information (this is CON).
  - The author points out that one is always *subconsciously* aware of the
    position of one's legs and pressure on certain body parts -- that
    information is always accessible, but not consciously on our minds.
    MG> I have noticed this phenomenon in the past, when for instance I become
        aware of the pace of my breath and the frequency of my blinking, but
        never considered it in this context before. There's so much that my
        body and brain process and do that I (if I can separate myself
        from these processes) am not consciously aware of!
 
o Selective attention and CON are different -- attention is not always
  conscious -- many times there is so much information that some attention
  must be given before deciding what to access.
 
o Another aspect of consciousness is vigilance -- described as "the level of
  excitement in cortical and thalamic networks that support conscious states",
  which is different than wakefulness.
  - Some people in vegetative states can be wakeful and yet not perceive any
    information.
 
o Consciousness has also been thought of as the ability to recognize
  oneself/have a sense of self (metacognition = "the ability to think about
  one's mind")
  - There are interesting experiments such as the red dot test (to see if
    children and animals recognize selves in the mirror), suggesting that
    humans are not alone in this type of consciousness.
    * The author says that the study of consciousness as a science should
      focus on CON as things like recursive consciousness, attention,
      wakefulness, and vigilance complicate things, and should be saved for
      later.
 
Minimal Contrasts
o Minimal contrast: a pair of experimental situations that are minimally
  different, but only one is consciously perceived.
  - Experiments that utilize this allow scientists to examine one variable,
    and exactly what events cause this switch from unaware to aware.
 
o The optical illusion where the grey dots disappear may be similar to the
  way our eyes must filter out blood vessels in front of photoreceptors
  MG> I've heard also in the past that we are constantly filtering out our
      nose from our field of sight as well. The depth to which our eyes and
      brain coordinate to create our field of vision astounds me!
 
Rival Images
 
o Binocular rivalry:
  - Our eyes notice two slightly different worlds, but our brains fuse this
    into one smooth view of the world
  - When Sir Charles Wheatstone [AC: 1838] did an experiment where each eye
    could see distinct images, the viewer's perception wavered between the
    two visions (the images "fight" for conscious perception).
 
o  In experiments involving monkeys, at earlier processing stages, cells
   acted objectively (firing regardless of whichever image the monkey
   indicated they perceived), whereas as visual processing progressed to
   "higher visual areas", neurons began to agree with what was consciously
   perceived, suggesting conscious perception relies on higher level
   association cortex.
 
When Attention Blinks
 
o The binocular rivalry requires attention -- once attention is removed, the
  rivaling neurons no longer act codependently.
 
o Attentional blink: by saturating the mind, there are brief periods of
  invisibility where the brain does not perceive certain things.
  - In one study, stream of symbols appears on computer screen, most digits,
    some are letters. Viewers are told to remember the letters, and if the
    second letter appears very close to the first, they are often unaware
    + Brain imaging reveals that viewers see all letters, but not all reach
      the processing that makes us aware
 
o Similar to binocular rivalry in that two images are competing, but instead
  these are temporally separated.
 
o Even if we think we can process multiple unrelated things at once, that is
  an illusion (CON has a [AC: SEQUENTIAL] bottleneck)
  - There's a refractory period, a delay period before further inputs are
    processed, which we are unaware of.
 
o Longer term, this phenomenon is known as "inattentional blindness" (like
  when a chess player is oblivious to his surroundings, and the invisible
  gorilla experiment)
 
o Change blindness- inattention making us unaware of significant changes (like
  the WHODUNNIT experiment)
 
Masking Conscious Perception
 
o Masking, or subliminal images:
  - For scientific studies, need to be able to make an image 100% invisible,
    no matter how informed participants are or how many times they view it.
  - Masking can do this -- images sandwiched between other images are
    "masked".
 
Primacy of the Subjective
o The author argues that subjective reports can be trusted, and form the
  primary data that should be recorded.
  - In his experiments, he found participants' introspection about whether
    they perceived an image consistent with their naming/memory abilities.
  - He concedes that introspection can be problematic, however
  - Neuroscientists must examine which neurobiological events contribute to
    subjective experience.
Chapter 2: Fathoming Unconscious Depths
 
Pioneers of the Unconscious
 
o Many philosophers spoke of the concept that much of our mental processing
  occurs outside of our consciousness.
 
The Seat of Unconscious Operations
 
o There were many theories regarding what parts of the brain correspond to
  conscious vs unconscious thought, but it's now known that virtually all
  regions participate in both types.
 
o Blindsight: patients with lesions on visual cortex behave as though blind in
  specific parts of visual field, but can still "blindly" point to sources of
  light (unconscious vision)
  - Research on patients with brain lesions suggested unconscious images are
    processed in the cortex
 
The Brain's Dark Side
 
o Subliminal priming:
  - Flashing subliminal word ("prime") (unconsciously) before another visible
    item ("target")
    + When the prime is the same word, the processing of the word is much
      faster, even when the case of the words is different.
    + Even though the first word is unconscious, the brain processes the
      fact that "radio" and "RADIO" are the same word
    + This experiment demonstrated that the ventral route (which processes
      the identity of pictures and words) also participates in unconscious
      processing, thus both routes (ventral and dorsal) can operate below
      conscious experience
 
Binding Without Consciousness
 
o Previous ideas that consciousness is needed to bind together individual
  elements of a visual scene disproven by the subliminal priming experiment,
  as "range" as a prime for "anger" did not have the same effect as "range"
  as a prime for "range" (meaning the subconscious was able to process and
  bind the letters in these words).
 
o Behind the scenes, our brains are constantly working to transform the light
  that enters our retinas into a 3D scene
 
         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8

Playing Chess Unconsciously
 
o Our brains can, in a fraction of a second, see an image and parse the
information without our knowledge
   - A chess expert can have an image of a chessboard flashed before their
     eyes and have it influence their decision
   - The optical illusion on page 61 shows how almost instantly, our brain
     parses the objects in the image and makes sense of it, all unconsciously
 
Seeing Voices
 
o Consciousness isn't even required to fuse visual and auditory signals!
o McGurk effect:
   - Video sounds like "da da da". If you close your eyes, it sounds like "ba
     ba ba". Visually, the mouth says "ga ga ga". The brain unconsciously makes
     sense of these conflicting signals by combining the sounds.
   MG> This is astounding to me, simply because even when one tries to hear
       the correct sound while watching the video, it is near impossible. Even
       when consciously aware of the effect, we can't prevent our brains from
       doing this processing!
o Wolf Singer suggested that there are two types of binding (of information):
   - Routine bindings that are coded by dedicated neurons committed to
     specific combinations of inputs
       + For example, our cortex likely has neurons dedicated to letter
         strings like "un", "the", and "tion"
   - Nonroutine bindings spawned by unforeseen combinations (may require a
     more conscious state)
 
Unconscious Meaning
 
o There has been controversy over whether a word's meaning can be processed
without consciousness, especially as consciousness and comprehension are so
 closely connected
   - "Cocktail party" effect: when you are in a room with dozens of
     conversations, you can focus in on one conversation, and unattended voices
     are blocked. However, why is it that if one of those unattended voices
     says your name, you will hear and respond?
       + Some believe that your brain unconsciously processes the unattended
         voices
       + Others may argue that your consciousness actually switches back and
         forth very quickly
   - The author says that the consensus now is that the unconscious mind
     proposes while the conscious mind selects:
       + Consider the word "bank", which can be a financial institution or a
         river bank
       + When a prime word (like bank) is masked down to the unconscious
         level, "money" and "water" are primed, meaning our unconscious mind
         stores all meanings, (while our conscious mind selects)
 
The Great Unconscious Wars
 
o There remained controversy over unconscious semantic processing, but even
 after taking greater care to make sure experiments were performed well, the
 results confirmed that words, digits, and pictures can be unconsciously
 processed
   - Anthony Greenwald demonstrated that emotion cuold be activated
     unconsciously (when prime words were congruent or incongruent with the
     word shown, participants performed better on congruent trials)
o However, this was later discredited (by Greenwald himself), as the
 priming, while subliminal, bypassed meaning and had to do more with the
 shallow association between sets of letters and their corresponding response
 
Unconscious Arithmetic
 
o Dehaene did a similar experiment, but with numbers instead of words. This
 involved flashing 1, 4, 6, or 9 and then showing a number, and asking whether
 the number shown is > or < than 5. The invisible numbers caused semantic
 priming
   - Whether the prime was 'four' or '4' didn't matter, suggesting that the
     effect was due to meaning rather than visual shapes
   - Activity in left and right parietal lobes, the "number sense" regions of
     the brain, decreased when the same number was displayed twice
     ("repetition suppression")
 
Combining Concepts Without Consciousness
 
o Brain imaging done on epileptic patients showed that the amygdala (which)
processes emotion, fires signals for words that were invisible to the patient
o N400 wave - brain wave that marks the brain's response to an unexpected
 meaning (whose size corresponds with the degree of absurdity)
   - This occurs even for words we don't see (because of masking or
     inattention)
   - The size of N400 is the same whether the words are conscious or invisible
o The author concludes that invisible words can elicit activation in meaning
networks, but unconscious activity is confined to a narrow brain circuit
 
Attentive but Unconscious
 
o Attention doesn't require awareness-our minds are not constantly examining
 everything around us and deciding what to focus on. Instead, this occurs
sub rosa, in parallel.
o This filter is "selective attention"
   - Loud noises and blinking lights can disrupt this, as they represent
     dangers
o "Attention can amplify a visual stimulus and still leave it too weak to
 break into our awareness" (76)
MG> I don't quite understand what Dehaene is saying here. How can one focus
     their attention on something if they can't even see it consciously?
o Conscious intentions can affect unconscious attention.
   - For example, if you're shown a set of shapes and told to detect the
     squares, and a square and circle appear (masked), something called N2pc
     (a marker of parietal lobe activation) shows an unconscious orientation
     towards the square
 
The Value of an Invisible Coin
 
o All the stimuli we receive is assigned a value by a set of neural networks
 within the basal ganglia
   - In one study, a picture of a penny or a pound coin was subliminally
     flashed, and although participants couldn't consciously see the image,
     their actions were influenced based on which image was flashed
   - Our brains unconsciously monitor the world around us and assign value to
     things. It is because of these tags that the most relevant events draw
     our attention
 
Unconscious Mathematics
 
o "We constantly overestimate our awareness--even when we are aware of the
 glaring gaps in our awareness."
   - Because we're not aware of our unconscious thoughts, we overestimate the
     degree to which our conscious thoughts influence us
o The mathemetician Henri Poincare made certain mathematical discoveries
 unconsciously - the idea would come to him when his mind was occupied by
 something else entirely
   MG> This is not altogether surprising to me. Sometimes the best cure for
   not knowing a solution to a problem is sleep. I have always wondered how
   sometimes letting my mind drift elsewhere can be the most useful way to
   solve a problem that has been bothering me.
o Dijksterhuis performed an experiment where participants had to choose the
 best car among four cars based on 12 criteria, and half were allowed to
 consciously think about their choice, while half were distracted. The
 "unconscious" decision group picked the best car 60% of the time, while the
 conscious group picked it 22% of the time.
   - The author says that some aspects of problem solving are better dealt
     mostly unconsciously
   MG> I'm not sure if I'm convinced that these examples show that largely
       unconscious decision making may sometimes be better. However,
       anecdotally speaking, I can agree with his statement.
   - One possible explanation is that the conscious group was too focused on
     a couple of the criteria, and weren't able to see the big picture, whereas
     unconscious processes excel at assigning values to many items and
     averaging them
o Dehaene provides examples of experiments where the subconscious is  
   somewhat able to average the number of arrows pointing to the right out of
   an image containing five arrows even when they aren't consciously able to
   see the arrows
 
Statistics During Sleep
 
o Dehaene describes an experiment in which participants had to perform a long
calculation, but there was a pattern in the numbers that, when discovered,
 allowed them to save time and effort. The researchers found that after a
 night of sleep, many participants woke up with the shortcut in mind.
   - During sleep, neurons in the hippocampus and cortex are active, and
     replay in fast forward the same sequences of activity from periods of
     wakefulness
   MG> I wonder if this is the reason why sometimes after performing a
   repetitive and/or mentally tasking task all day, I have dreams about that
   doing that same task. It's interesting to consider this phenomenon in terms
   of the neurons "replaying" the sequences that occurred during the day
 
A Subliminal Bag of Tricks
 
o Psychology has demontrated that subliminal perception exists, and that many
 processes can run without consciousness
o Some even argue that the subliminal self may be superior to the conscious
 self
   - Many say that the mental operations underlying our decisions are
     unconscious, and our consciousness is a bystander
o In the next chapter, Dehaene will refute this "zombie" theory, arguing that
 consciousness is an evolved feature with a use
 
Chapter 3: What is Consciousness Good for?
 
o Consciousness is stable, while subliminal information is quickly fading.
Consciousness also compresses information into small, bite sized pieces,
 whereas subliminal information is large and ever changing
 
o Darwin's ideas about natural selection overturned previous ideas that every
 feature had a specific function for a specific purpose (teleology)
   - Several other ideas also go along with this theory:
       + Spontaneous pattern generation: certain chemical reactions can cause
         organized features like zebra stripes and melon ribs
       + Allometric relations: some features that may not seem evolutionarily
         advantageous, like the Irish elk's huge horns, may have been due to an
         increase in the overall size of the organism, which would provide
         evolutionary advantage
       + Spandrels: features of organisms that don't seem advantageous may
         have arisen as a byproduct of its architecture (for instance, the male
         nipple is an outcome of the development of the advantageous
         female breasts)
o This means that consciousness cannot be thought of as necessarily having a
 specific benefit or purpose
   - Dehaene questions whether consciousness is a mere byproduct
       + We could perform many of our cognitive functions just as well
         as unconscious zombies
       + "User illusion": our feeling of being in control may be fallacious
   - Dehaene chooses to explore the functionalist view, which is that
     consciousness is useful, and that it has been selected over millions of
     years because it serves a role
 
Unconscious Statistics, Conscious Sampling
 
o Dehaene describes our mind's processing as a division of labor: there are
 myriad levels below that do the tedious work of creating the most complete
 interpretation of our environment, whereas our consciousness exists a level
 above, like executives making high level decisions
   - Consciousness is what allows us to make decisions, and what prevents us
     from becoming like the donkey that died standing between a pail of water
     and a stack of hay
o Bayesian influence: using statistical reasoning in a backwards manner to
 infer the hidden causes behind our observations
   - There's a theory that the brain acts in this way (backwards)
       + In perceiving a plate as a circle, and not an ellipse, for example,
         the brain has weeded out a vast array of other explanations
       + Each individual neuron suffers from the "aperture problem" (viewing
         a stick through a peephole doesn't allow you to see its true motion);
         however, we do not see this ambiguity, as our brains let us see the
         most likely interpretations. This process takes time, but we only
         perceive the end result.
       MG> Dehaene talks about how this ability of our neurons to agree on a
           single interpretation disappears when someone is under anesthesia.
           How do they know this? I wish he'd go into more detail here.
       + In an experiment showing two superimposed gratings (a visual
         ambiguity), our perception changes every few seconds. What we see is
         the most likely interpretation, but other possibilities pop up
         sometimes, for a duration proportional to their statistical
         likelihood. "Our unconscious perception works out the possibilities--
         and then our consciousness samples from them at random." This seems
         only to occur when conscious attention is focused on the input.
o Overall theme: unconscious processes are fast and parallel, whereas
 consciousness is the slow sampler
 
Lasting Thoughts
 
o Working memory: the part of short term memory focused on immediate conscious
perception and linguistic processing
   - Associated with the prefrontal cortex
   - Consciousness may have had a specific evolutionary role: learning over
     time, rather than just living in the instant
       + The eye-closure reflex experiment (a loud noise coincides with or
         is followed by a burst of air to the eye) demonstrates that
         coincidence based conditioning is unconscious, while memory-trace
         learning requires being aware of the predictive link
o The duration of a visible image in our brains is much higher than those made
invisible by masking (to the point where after around a second, unconscious
 activation is undetectable)
   - Only consciousness allows for lasting thoughts
 
The Human Turing Machine
 
o Performing multidigit arithmetic allows us to recite the "algorithm" our
 minds used. Dehaene says that performing complex strategies using multiple
 steps (algorithms) is a uniquely evolved function of consciousness
   - "The conscious brain operates as a biological Turing machine"
       + He qualifies this by saying that while this applies when the brain
         is engaged in long calculations, the brain itself is radically
         different from modern computers
o While our unconscious minds can access a wide array of information, our
 conscious brains are needed to act on this information in certain ways
 (calculations, using certain strategies, etc.)
   - We need consciousness to rationally think about problems. The
     unconscious generates hunches, whereas only the conscious can go through
     step by step

A Social Sharing Device

o Consciousness is a means through which to transfer information between people
  in a condensed manner
    - One important component of this communication is the ability to relay our 
      confidence in/the reliability of our knowledge
        + This helps us to make decisions (through weighing each source of 
          information by reliability), and compare our knowledge with others to 
          perform collective decision making
    - The brain contains structures that accumulate our self-knowledge and
      information about others, representing "onself as another"
      MG> I wonder if this is in any way related to the question posed about 
          "I" being ambiguous. On a (somewhat) related note, many times I find
          myself in my inner dialogue talking to myself in the second person, as
          if I were another person talking to myself. In that sense I could see 
          the usage of "I" being a little off as well.

Chapter 4: The Signatures of a Conscious Thought

o In 1990, fMRI technology allowed the brain's activity to be observed by
  tracking red blood cell movement through hemoglobin molecules
    - Electroencephalography recording of brain waves also provide recordings of
      brain activity

The Avalanche of Consciousness

o In multiple experiments, when the conscious threshold was passed, brain 
  activity surged in higher visual centers (behaving like a sort of avalanche)
    - When crossing the conscious threshold, an amplification of brain activity
      occurs, progressively gathering strength and invading multiple regions of 
      the brain including the parietal and prefontal circuits (signature 1)

Timing the Conscious Avalanche

o In 1995 Dehaene performed an experiment where he was able to isolate the
  timing of CON
    - Words were flashed at the exact moment of attentional blink, such that
      viewers missed half of the words. This allowed Dehaene to observe the 
      differences in brain waves between words where CON was achieved or wasn't
    - Around 200-300ms after the onset, brain activity in unconscious trials 
      faded, while in conscious trials it progressed to the front of the brain, 
      producing an avalanche that is picked up by markers, known as the P3 wave
      (signature 2)
o Whenever the parietal and prefontal lobes are processing a stimulus, they
  then can't process a second. Sometimes we do perceive it, but after a delay.
  This is the PRP (that is examined in the 2010 Marti et al. paper)

Consciousness Lags Behind the World

o Our consciousness lags by at least 1/3 of a second, moreso when we are 
  distracted. However, we have certain mechanisms that help us cope with this:
    - Sometimes we act on "auto-pilot", like when our finger retracts from a 
      hot surface before we're consciously aware of it
    - Anticipation: we perceive predictable stimuli sooner than unpredictable
      ones
o In cases where people are told to move their eyes away from a flash of light
  (counter to the usual reaction), at first, their eyes are magnetically 
  attracted to the light. Only after this initial response does the conscious
  response occur, a response indistinguishable from the aforementioned P3 wave.

Isolating the Conscious Moment

o To fully isolate CON and equalize all other factors, a trial must equalize
  the stimuli and responses, such that everything is identical except the 
  subjective feeling of conscious vision
    - Salti did just that, and confirmed that the P3 wave is a signature of
      conscious access
        + Utilized blind sight - responses where they were unaware of any
          stimuli, but still responded correctly - this meant that the stimuli
          and response was the same. The only difference was the P3 wave,
          which was much larger on conscious trials

Igniting the Conscious Brain

o "Global ignition" - the term for the large-scale activity pattern response
  in the brain to stimuli
    - Neurons excite one another in a similar manner to the way applause bursts
      from a crowd, and once the excitation exceeds a threshold, it becomes
      self-reinforcing, meaning neurons excite other neurons that return the 
      excitation
o Dehaene performed an experiment varying the SOA between a short stimuli
  followed by a mask of random letters. As the SOA increased continuously,
  visibility did not increase continuously; instead there was a threshold of 
  50 ms. The P3 wave once again corresponded with reports of CON

Deep Inside the Conscious Brain

o Experiments on epileptic patients confirmed this "global ignition" theory
    - Unconscious information is confined to a narrow circuit, whereas conscious
      information is distributed to larger areas for extended periods. Conscious
      words resulted in gamma rhythms (high frequency oscillations) persisting 
      much longer than unconscious words (signature 3).

The Brain Web

o Fourth signature: massive synchronization of electromagnetic signals across
  the cortex
    - This synchronization allows for the facilitation of information spread
    - While invisible images create only temporary synchrony, conscious images
      create an exchange of reciprocal signals called a "brain web"

The Tipping Point and Its Precursors

o Summary:
    - Conscious perception is a result of a wave of neuronal activity, exceeding
      the cortex's threshold for ignition
    - This causes an avalanche of activity, igniting many regions to a state
      (consciousness) ~300ms after onset
    - The frontal regions of the brain are informed of sensory input in a bottom
      up manner, but sending projections in a top-down manner
    - The result is a "brain web" of synchronization with distributed activation
      in the frontal and parietal lobes, a P3 wave, gamma-band activation, and 
      synchronization across long distances
o Dehaene distinguishes between factors that correlate with CON (such as those
  signals that occur as early as 100ms after the stimulus onset, or even those 
  that appear beforehand), and those that actually play a hand in CON
