--- BEGIN Notes on Quora Summary of Scott Aaronson's critique of IIT
Zenil's Answer

o According to Zenil, Aaronson finds it strange that grids can be conscious, and
  that consciousness grows as a function of grid size
  - Zenil critiques Scientific American's praise of Aaronson's views, even 
    though Zenil himself has some critiques of IIT as well:
    + There are many versions of the measure phi
      MG> This is interesting, because I also thought that phi was unclear. 
          Zenil seems to say that there have been many iterations of phi, each
          presented as final. My confusion was that there seemed to be
          conflicting definitions of phi (one as a measure of irreducibility,
          another as a measure of cause-effect power), but again this was likely
          due to my lack of expertise on the subject.

Bach's Answer

o Bach describes Tononi's IIT as the following: 
  - Consciousness is defined by how much the information in a system depends on 
  other parts, which is a measure of global information integration (phi)
o Bach describes Aaronson's critique as follows:
  - We can construct a matrix operation that has a large phi value, but is 
    not conscious, and that while integration might be necessary for conscious 
    systems, it's not sufficient
--- END Notes on Quora Summary of Scott Aaronson's critique of IIT

--- BEGIN Notes on Aaronson's "Why I Am Not An Integrated Information Theorist"
Aaronson begins by summarizing IIT as follows:
o Phi is a quantitative measure of the amount of "integrated" information
  in a physical system, or information that can't be localized within the 
  system's individual parts
o A physical system is "conscious" if and only if it has a large phi value, 
  and larger phi values mean that a system is more conscious
  MG> This is what Tononi said: "The quantity of consciousness — how much the 
  system exists for itself — corresponds to its irreducibility phi max."
o According to Aaronson, in order for IIT to succeed, phi must be small for 
  intuitively unconscious systems, and large for intuitively conscious systems,
  which he says is a crucial point in which IIT fails

What should a "mathematical theory of consciousness" do?
o Explain why consciousness exists/solve the "hard problem", or how neurons
  give rise to experience
  - Aaronson says this may be too much to ask of a scientific theory-no matter 
    what facts the theory suggested, it'd be easy to imagine a universe where 
    these facts were true and consciousness didn't exist. In the case of IIT, 
    it's easy to imagine a universe full of beings with a high phi value who are 
    not conscious ("philosophical zombies")
    + Many people might then say that the "hard problem" is dismissable/a 
      distraction from real neuroscience. However, Aaronson says that you can't 
      both dismiss the hard problem as meaningless and say that the problem
      may soon be solved by neuroscience.
  - Aaronson says, however, that IIT largely survives the above criticism, as 
    it aims to show which systems are associated with consciousness and which 
    aren't in terms of the system's physical organization.
  - Theories should be able to pass "common sense" test cases, showing that 
    humans are conscious, dogs are less so, and things like rocks and bacterial
    colonies aren't conscious. Aaronson calls this the "Pretty-Hard Problem".
    + In his view, IIT fails the pretty-hard problem because it predicts 
      vast amounts of consciousness in physical systems that no person would
      regard as conscious (and that they can be more conscious than humans)
o Aaronson goes on to define phi, mentioning that he found it difficult to find 
  a mathematical definition that listed formulas as well as the structures 
  mentioned in the formula
  MG> I found this math to be a little bit over my head. Particularly the line 
      that stated "the input variables in B are fixed to their values in y" 
      whereas the input variables in A are drawn randomly. As well, the relation 
      between EI and phi was similarly confusing. Perhaps during our next 
      meeting we can go over these equations.
  MG> Maybe because I'm still struggling with the mathematics, but I fail to see
      how these equations connect to IIT and, specifically, the brain-what part 
      of the brain would represent y, or A and B, or the function f?
o Aaronson summarizes the difficulties attempting empirical work in IIT: 
  1. We don't know the interconnection network of the brain
  2. It's not clear what should be defined as a network
     + A crude first attempt could be assigning a boolean to each neuron, with 
       f updating the variables every millisecond, but what other variables are 
       needed?
  3. Even if we did know what each of the variables and the functions were to 
     be in the brain, attempting to calculate phi would be an NP-hard problem
  o Aaronson says, however, that his reasons for rejecting IIT are not due to 
    anything listed above, but rather that a large phi value is not sufficient
    for consciousness
    - He describes a "hack" in which he applies a Vandermonde matrix with
      another matrix W and applies it to an input vector, which results in a 
      large phi value, such that if the input were large enough, the phi would
      exceed that of the human brain.
      + This tells us that integrated information can exist without 
        consciousness or intelligence
      + Aaronson also refutes possible critiques which say that he is too
        abstract/mathematic, that if one built a system that could actually 
        compute his mathematical system, the phi value of that physical system
        of wires and logic gates would actually be small. He gives lDPC codes
        and linear-size superconcentrators as examples of "simple"
        computational processes that achieve global integration of information
      MG> Again, this math was above me, so I may have misinterpreted/misstated
          something. But I think, on a high level, I understand the point that 
          Aaronson is trying to make.
o Aaronson ends by concluding that the fact that IIT is demonstrably wrong puts
  it in the top 2% of mathematical theories of consciousness, as others are so
  vague and "fluffy" that they can only "aspire to wrongness"
--- END Notes on Aaronson's "Why I Am Not An Integrated Information Theorist"

--- BEGIN Notes on Tononi's "Why Scott should stare at a blank wall"
o Tononi begins by summarizing Aaronson's arguments that:
  - Theories of consciousness should solve the pretty hard problem, or make 
    predictions about which things are conscious in line with common sense
    intuition
  - IIT defines phi that's meant to measure quantity of consciousness
  - Certain systems such as expander gates are not conscious, and yet have large 
    phi values, therefore IIT is wrong
  - He notes that Aaronson doesn't take into account IIT's latest phi, as well 
    as how IIT addresses identification of the appropriate spatio-temporal grain
    at which phi should be calculated
o Tononi argues that Aaronson's intuition that simple systems, such as a 2D 
  grid of physically implemented logic gates, cannot be conscious, is wrong

Pre-theoretical intuitions can be wrong or contradictory

o Tononi warns of the dangers of relying on pre-theoretical decisions as 
  Aaronson does. In the case of consciousness, he says, there are many
  conflicting intuitions about what qualities (self-reflection, language, 
  humor, intelligence) are needed for consciousness, and whether certain 
  animals and/or machines can be considered conscious.
  - Thus, says Tononi, we need to rely on a strict definition based on facts 
    about our own consciousness, not intuitions. He then goes on to summarize
    the axioms of IIT, noting that these are true of his own experience:
    + Existence 
    + Composition (composed of aspects)
    + Information (differs from others)
    + Integration (can't be split into independent components)
    + Singular (can't have multiple experiences)
  - Tononi summarizes the postulates of IIT as well:
  + Existence (system exists)
  + Composition (made of submechanisms each w/ their own power)
  + Information (has a conceptual structure specified by each mechanism's 
    concept)
  + Integration
  + Singular (can't be multiple conceptual structures over same mechanisms)
o Tononi says that theories of consciousness must do the following:
  - Explain established facts about consciousness and the brain, such as 
    that consciousness depends on the cortex and not the cerebellum and vanishes
    during dreamless sleep
  - Make predictions that can be empirically tested
  - Help make inferences about situations that are difficult to judge (such as
    unresponsive individuals with cortical activity, newborns, etc.)
  - Be able to predict things that are counterintuitive
    + Complicated biological systems that don't have the right architecture 
      should be judged as unconscious
      MG> Here, it feels like Tononi is defining the "right architecture" as 
          something with a high phi value. But isn't this how his IIT determines
          whether something is conscious as well? In other words, he is defining
          whether something should be predicted conscious based on the very same 
          principle that his theory uses, so of course his theory would make the
          correct "counterintuitive" prediction.
o Tononi then explains why certain 2D grids may be conscious
  1. Phenomenology
     - 2D space is part of our phenomenology- we experience things in space
       + Tononi discusses staring at a blank wall-though the wall is blank,
         one is aware of locations in space, distances. According to IIT, there
         must be physical mechanisms that specify phenomenological relationships
         (of 2D space) through their causal power
  2. Implications of IIT's postulates
     - Tononi describes a grid of physical elements capable of being in 2 
       different states that have interconnections to near neighbors, and that 
       the grid takes no inputs/outputs. He says that over time, the 
       cause-effect repertoire of each element of the grid is specified, and 
       if the repertoire is maximally irreducible, it specifies the concept.
       Thus, analyzing the grid using IIT postulates generates a highly 
       irreducible concept, that identifies the causal role of each element,
       orders the element in 2D, and specifies the distance among elements.
       Tononi says that this grid could specify 2D space, which consists of 
       spatial locations, their ordering, and distances, etc.
  3. Explanatory power
     - Many areas of the cortex are arranged like grids, called maps because
       elements correspond with parameters of the environment
       + Cortical 2D maps are grids, in that each element is connected to 
         other elements of the map, such that closer elements are more strongly
         connected
       MG> I wish Tononi would describe how these findings about maps were 
           discovered, and provide more details about these connections. Are 
           the connections neurons, or are the neurons the elements?
       + Tononi concedes that there are categorical elements of consciousness
         (such as faces) that are not topologically organized. However, he says 
         that even such faces have a location in space, and thus the binding 
         between spatial and categorical attributes of an object require
         connections between areas extracting the two.
  4. Predictive power
     - Topographical areas of the cortex contribute greatly to consciousness, 
       and lesioning or stimulating such areas affects experience directly
       + Lesions in the primary visual cortex (V1) lead to blindness
       + Stimulation of V1 causes visual "phosphenes"
       + Tononi concludes that topologically organized cortical maps likely 
         contribute directly to our experiences
         MG> To me, it still that Tononi is not addressing the "necessary, but
             sufficient" argument that Aaronson mentioned. Yes, this topological
             organization might be present in cortical areas, but how can 
             Tononi be sure that it is the grid-like structure that is 
             responsible for consciousness? 
       + Tononi does go on to address the "necessary, but sufficient" argument.
         He concedes that there could be some other property that causes 
         consciousness, but says the burden is on others to show that such 
         properties do so better than IIT. 
         MG> So Tononi does address this argument. I'm not sure that I agree 
             with his reasoning, however. Just because another property that
             can account for consciousness has not yet been found and shown
             does not mean that one doesn't exist. 
o Tononi summarizes his argument for conscious grids:
  - 2D space, phenomenologically, has a relational structure of locations, their
    ordering, and their distances
  - 2D grids can generate a conceptual structure that through causal mechanisms 
    specifies relationships among elements (identities, ordering, and distances)
  - Much of the cerebral cortex is organized like a 2D grid, and the mapping of 
    features seems related to experience
  - Manipulating such grids can alter experience
o He concludes that simple grids can support, rather than invalidate, IIT
--- END Notes on Tononi's "Why Scott should stare at a blank wall"

--- BEGIN Notes on Scientific American article "Can IIT Explain Consciousness"
o Panpsychism: doctrine that consciousness is a property of all matter
  - Horgan says that IIT implies panpsychism might be true
o Horgan summarizes IIT as follows:
  - An experience is identical to a conceptual structure that is maximally 
    irreducible, and a conceptual structure specifies the quantity and 
    quality of experience. The level of consciousness is measured by phi_max
o Exclusion- many parts of the brain can have their own values of phi, but 
  because phi of the entire brain exceeds that of its components, the brain's
  consciousness excludes the "mini-minds" of the components
  - The consciousness of a group of people can exclude that of individual 
    people, rendering them "zombies"
  MG> I'm not sure that I agree that this principle of exclusion works when 
      discussing groups of people, especially since one of the only things 
      we can be sure of when discussing consciousness is that we (people) are 
      conscious. Just because a group of people is interconnected/might have a 
      larger phi value than the individual people, to me, doesn't mean that 
      the individuals are no longer conscious
o Horgan discusses Searle's criticisms of IIT as well, which relate to IIT's 
  dependence on information and the fact that certain information is 
  consciousness
  MG> I'm not sure I understand what they mean by information here. Is 
      information the states of the elements of the physical systems 
      described by IIT? Is it the physical systems itself?

Abstract 

o This opinion article discusses Integrated information theory (IIT) and how it 
  describes the relationship between consciousness and the brain.
o IIT starts with properties of conscious experience, and derives from it 
  the properties of the physical substrate of consciousness (PSC)

Introduction

o Consciousness is subjective experience that depends on certain regions of the 
  brain. The relationship between the brain and consciousness is still not 
  established.
  - The 'hard problem'- why are some neural mechanisms associated with 
    consciousness but others not?
o IIT does not start from the brain and examine how it could give rise to 
  conscious experience
  - Instead, IIT starts from the phenomenon of conscious experience itself
    + From axioms of this experience, IIT describes postulates that are 
      characteristics required for physical substrates of consciousness
o This paper summarizes the axioms and postulates, and discuss how IIT 
  explains the relationship between consciousness and the brain and allows 
  for further inferences about consciousness

From phenomenology to physics

o The axioms of experience are described below. IIT postulates that for each of 
  these properties, there must be a corresponding causal property of the PSC
  1. Intrinsic experience: consciousness and each experience exist 
     - The only fact one can be sure of is one's own existence
  2. Composition: consciousness is structured, or composed of distinct phenomena
     - Within an experience, I might distinguish a chair, the color green, and
       a backpack
  3. Information: experience is specific, composed of a particular set of 
     distinctions that make it different from other experiences
     - In the example mentioned above, my experience involves seeing a backpack 
       (rather than no backpack)
  4. Integration: experience is unitary, composed of distinct phenomena bound 
     together, and is irreducible to independent subsets
     - A visual experience cannot be reduced to the left and right visual field
  5. Exclusion: experience is definite in its content
     - An experience includes the content it includes, no less and no more
     - Experiences are also definite in duration

o The postulates of the PST are described below (each number corresponds with 
  the axiom of experience of the same number):
  1. The PSC exists intrinsically as well, to account for the intrinsic 
     existence of experience
     - To exist in a physical sense, it must have cause-effect power- it must
       be able to change its state. A neuron in the brain can be active or 
       inactive, and can have inputs (causes) and outputs to other neurons 
       (effects)
  2. The elements that constitute the PSC must have cause-effect power within 
     the PSC 
     MG> I'm having trouble seeing how this postulate is related to the axiom of 
         composition. How do the elements composing the PSC, and their 
         cause-effect power, relate to the elements of an experience? (see later
         MG NOTE)
  3. The PSC must specify a cause-effect structure of a specific form that makes 
     it different from other possible forms
     - Cause-effect structure: the set of cause-effect repertoires specified by 
       all mechanisms of a system 
       + Mechanism: subset of system elements
       + Cause-effect repertoires: specify the full cause-effect power of a 
         mechanism in a particular state
     MG> This postulate is pretty hard to conceptualize. Although, I'm now 
         starting to better understand how the postulates relate to the axioms. 
         Before, my understanding was that each postulate would describe a PSC 
         characteristic that would directly give rise to the corresponding axiom
         of experience. However, it seems to me that instead, the postulates 
         suggest the PSC has similar characteristics as the axiom. These may 
         be one and the same, however. (see later MG NOTE)
    4. The cause-effect structure specified by the PSC must also be unitary, or
       irreducible to cause-effect structures specified by independent 
       systems
       - This means that each part of the system has both causes and effects 
         within the rest of the system
       - The irreducibility of each cause-effect repertoire is represented by
         phi (the minimum distance between an intact and a partitioned 
         cause-effect repertoire) 
    5. The cause-effect structure specified by the PSC must be definite
       - There must be a definite set of cause-effect repertoires over a 
         definite set of elements

    MG NOTE> Much of my confusion was cleared up when I realized (perhaps later
             than I should have) that the postulates describing the PSC would 
             describe not only the brain, but also any sort of computational 
             model that aimed to achieve consciousness. For some reason I 
             understand the postulates and how they relate to the axioms much 
             better when considering a computational model/system rather than 
             the brain. In fact, this leaves me wondering whether these 
             postulates are meant to describe the brain, as they don't seem to 
             mesh well with my current understanding of how the brain works. 

o Complex: a set of elements in a state that satisfies the postulates of IIT
  - This constitutes the PSC
o An experience is identical to a conceptual structure- every property of an 
  experience must correspond to a property of the conceptual structure, and 
  vice versa
  - The quality/content of consciousness corresponds to the form of the 
    conceptual structure

The PSC within the brain 

o The neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) are likely located in parts of the 
  cortico-thalamic system (connect the thalamus to cerebral cortex), but where 
  specifically?
  - Are the NCC fixed, or can they shrink, or move?
  - IIT says the following:
    + Content specific NCC: the neural elements of the PSC in a particular state 
      that specify a phenomenal content 
    + Full NCC: the neural elements of the PSC irrespective of their state
    + Background conditions: factors that enable consciousness
    + The PSC corresponds to the complex of neural elements w/ maximum 
      cause-effect power

o Elements of the PSC
  - Want to figure out what scale of neural elements supporting consciousness is
    + IIT says: the neural elements are those w/ the maximum cause-effect power
    + Exhaustive evaluation of cause-effect power at multiple levels is only 
      possible in small simulated networks 
      - Experiments are possible in real networks that assess the repertoire of 
        individual neurons and recording firing of neurons and testing the 
        irreducibility of the neurons. This is the micro level.
      - At the macro level, a similar experiment could be run, instead 
        considering subsets of neurons
      - A researcher could empirically test whether the firing of a single 
        neuron or the activity of a cortical minicolumn (comprised of 80-120 
        neurons) makes a difference to the content of an experience
o Timescale
  MG> One phrase that keeps appearing is "temporal grain". I think I understand 
      enough to understand the word in context, but I wish they'd define this 
      more clearly. (Looking this up yielded very little as well)
  - The timescale that makes the most difference to the system (has the maximum 
    cause-effect power in the relevant brain regions) should be the timescale 
    of the PSC 
o State of the elements
  - According to IIT: the only neural states that matter for consciousness are 
    those with maximum cause-effect power on the system
    + This means that "finer grained" neural states that can have demonstrable 
      neuro-physiological effects make no difference to the content of 
      experience according to IIT 
    MG> This seems like a weakness of IIT to me. It's likely that I'm not fully
        grasping the meaning of "maximum cause-effect power", but it seems 
        strange to me that only the states with the maximum power would 
        affect the experience- why would any other states exist if they had 
        no effect? Am I oversimplifying?
o Constitution of the PSC
  - Want to find the subset of neuronal groups that constitute the PSC for a 
    particular experience, or the subset with the maximally irreducible 
    cause-effect power on itself (phi)
    + Ideally would manipulate/record this set to show it has the maximum phi,
      but currently this type of evaluation isn't possible
o Can the PSC change?
  - When one is sleeping or watching a movie that prevents self-reflective 
    thought, does the PSC shrink, or sill include those less active areas in an 
    inactive state?
  - The authors say that the PSC can become smaller or reconfigure
  - Methods that allow inactivation of certain cortical areas (such as TMS) can
    help with evaluation of their importance to consciousness 
o Multiple complexes 
  - IIT states that multiple discrete PSCs can coexist within a single brain 
  - Major complex: the complex that specifies a person's typical stream of 
    consciousness
    + After a split brain operation, the major complex can split 
    + In normal, healthy brains, splitting might occur during dual-task 
      conditions (like driving on autopilot while having engaging conversation)
      MG> Doesn't the PSC only deal with conscious activity? I think autopilot 
          could be considered unconscious
    + Another possibility: multiple conscious streams in daily life, or perhaps 
      a separate minor complex that supports unconscious operations
o Figure 2 shows trials that identify the elements, timescale, and states of the 
  PSC 
  MG> I wish they provided more information on how these trials were conducted. 
      What sorts of methods and technology did they use to gather this data? 

Information capacity of consciousness

o The estimate for information capacity of human consciousness is around 40 bits 
  per second
  - The authors mention phenomena such as attentional blink and change blindness
  - While these phenomena occur, there is a difference between what one 
    experiences and what one can report. For instance, 
o IIT claims consciousness has a high capacity for integrated information 
  - Apart from being able to identify high invariance concepts (such as 
    identifying letters on a screen), humans are able to recognize many other 
    low and high order, low and high invariance, positive and negative concepts, 
    and relations that machines may not be able to recognize
    + These include the arrangement of rows, the color of the background, the 
      absence of a face or house 

Explanations 

o IIT can explain why the cerebral cortex is important in consciousness, but 
  the cerebellum is not
  - The cortex has gridlike connectivity among neurons, whereas the cerebellum 
    is composed of microzones with independent inputs and outputs
o IIT also explains the fading of consciousness during slow wave sleep 
  - Changes in neuromodulation cause cortical neurons to become bistable (input 
    triggers a neuronal down-state, after which neurons enter an up-state and 
    activity resumes)
  MG> I don't quite understand how or why this results in a loss of 
      consciousness. I guess I can see how the downstate and upstate is 
      different than than the chain of deterministic effects that occurs during 
      wakefulness. Perhaps a better question would be how the lack of 
      neuromodulation causes this bistability.
o IIT can also account for why conscious brains might have evolved:
  - Brains that can incorporate the causal structure of the environment into 
    their own causal structure have an evolutionary advantage 
    + This has been modeled in simulations involving placing animats (simulated 
      organisms) with varying phi values into mazes

Predictions 

o Predictions of IIT: the PSC must be a maximum of intrinsic cause-effect power, 
  and the spatio-temporal grain is that which yields the max phi value 
  - Testing these predictions is difficult but possible
    + One empirical measure, PCI- perturbational complexity index - gauges the 
      intrinsic cause-effect power (proxy for phi max)
      MG> I thought phi was a measure of the irreducibility of a cause-effect 
          repertoire, not its cause-effect power. Are these the same?
      - The PCI is high only if brain responses are integrated and 
        differentiated, confirming the IIT prediction
    + Another method is observing the average properties of neural interactions 
      based on a representative sample of neural states, then analyzing using 
      measures of differentiation/integration
o Some of these predictions include:
  - Qualitative features of experience correspond with features of the PSC's 
    conceptual structure 
  - Spatial structure of experience is reflected in features of conceptual 
    structures
  - Changes in the connections among elements of the PSC cause changes in 
    experience, rather than whether the elements are firing 
o Supplementary Figure 5
  - Contrasts the GNWT (global neuronal workspace theory) with IIT, specifically 
    how one becomes conscious of seeing a face 
    + GNWT: information is unconscious if processed locally, but becomes 
      conscious or "enters the workspace" if the information is "broadcast" 
      when the fronto-parietal workspace is "ignited", with synchrony and the 
      P3b wave 
    MG> This is the model that Dehaene explains with the 4 signatures of 
        consciousness
    + IIT: the "face" neuron in the PSC turns to burst firing, changing the 
      form of the conceptual structure 

Conclusions 

o IIT starts from axioms of experience and translates them into conditions 
  or postulates for the PSC
o If validated, IIT might cause reconsideration of consciousness as we know it

--- BEGIN Notes on preprint of Metacognition for a Common Model of Cognition
Definitions

o Cognition is defined in the paper as a repeating perceive-decide-act cycle
  - Perceive: related to the signals that describe the environment in which 
    the agent exists
  - Decide: the processes that result in a decision about the action to execute 
    + Can include attention, conscious access, planning, etc.
  - Act: the ultimate outcome of the cognitive cycle, usually resulting in motor 
    response
o Metacognition: cognition about cognition, or any cognitive process about 
  another cognitive process (e.g. reasoning about reasoning)
  - A process is metacognitive if and only if it receives input from, sends
    sends output to, or both receives from and sends to the same process type 
    (perception, decision, action)

General Categories:
o Category 1: Decision -> Decision 
  - Signals from other decisions provide the input, and the output is directed
    at other decisions with the intent to modulate them 
  - Examples:
    + Arbitration of model-free vs model-based reinforcement learning
      - These account for habitual and goal-directed behavior, respectively 
      - The arbitrator is a meta-control mechanism whose input is the estimated 
        reliability of the MF and MB systems, which determines how much control
        to give to each system
    + Self-representation 
      - Self concept allows us to situate ourselves in the world and reflect on
        how we act and feel 
      - The ventral medial prefrontal cortex mediates self concept 
    + Reflection and self-improvement
      - The aforementioned self concept allows us to reflect on ourselves and 
        improve ourselves 
        + This requires a way to assess one's performance, and to develop new 
          heuristics, and gradually incorporating into decision making 
    + Self-control 
      - In a functional imaging study examining the brain activity of dieters,
        it was found that the dieters' health or weight loss self concept 
        (higher level) affected the valuation process in the striatum (lower 
        level), lowering the value for junk food, rather than permitting 
        competition between higher and lower level systems
        MG> This is really interesting. I wonder then, why it is that so often 
            dieters fail to maintain their diet. If it is the case that the 
            valuation process in the striatum is actually changed such that
            junk food is valued less, why do so many return to junk food? That 
            suggests perhaps the value is not lowered enough.
    + Artificial Category-1
      MG> I believe in this section the authors discuss artificial systems that
          model Category 1 metacognition, but the authors don't explain very 
          clearly what each architecture is or how exactly they relate to 
          metacognition.

o Category 2: Decision -> Action 
  - Unlike in Category 1, where output is sent to another decision process,
    Category 2 metacognition leads to action and decision making, and can be
    behavioral-control and problem solving systems. It takes input from lower 
    level decision processes to influence its own decisions.
  - Examples:
    + Social cognition
      - Social cognition requires agents to have a self-concept, as well as 
        models of others in the environment
      - Processing scial constructs and rules may be meta-cognitive, 
        but it depends on how they are processed or modeled
      - Coordination with other cognitive systems may require coordination among 
        sets of cognitive processes, which is metacognition 
      MG> I must admit I'm confused as to how social cognition is related at all
          to category 2 metacognition. It seems as though they emphasized how 
          social cognition is indeed metacognition, but didn't relate it back to
          Category 2, which I thought was more related to making higher level 
          decisions to take action
    + Artificial Category-2 Metacognition 
      - Artificial Category-2 metacognition includes models of social cognition  

o Category 3: Perception -> Decision
  - Environmental stimuli/perceptual processes form the input to Category-3 
    metacognition, and the output goes to other cognitive processes
  - Example: context and abstract task relevant information
    MG> Not exactly sure what this means-does it mean that taking in stimuli
        about one's context/environment and deciding what is relevant is 
        category 3 metacognition?
  - Higher order brain regions (like the prefrontal cortex) provide 
    environmental information to decision-making systems
    MG> The activation of the prefrontal cortex is one of Dehaene's signatures
        of consciousness. It makes sense that this region is responsible for 
        environmental information in decision making.

o The authors mention that in practice, category boundaries are fuzzy

Components of Metacognition
o (This section focuses on Category-1 metacognition)
o The components of metacognition are as follows: (INPUT) decision process -> 
  monitoring -> evaluation -> planning -> simulation -> modulation & control ->
  (OUTPUT) decision process
  - Monitoring: the metacognitive process receives input from the cognitive 
    processes it attempts to influence. 
  - Evaluation: Activity received from monitored systems is evaluated. 
    + An example in the brain is a region in the prefrontal cortex arbitrates 
      between behavioral-control systems with an evaluation process comparing 
      likelihood of success
  - Planning: Evaluation includes an assessment of future success and
    identifying the best actions to achieve success
    MG> Is this separate from evaluation? I'm having trouble distinguishing the
        two
  - Mental Simulation: Similar to planning, simulation allows the playing out of 
    possible scenarios before choosing an action, requiring rich mental models 
    of the environment 
    + Consciousness is important in forming mental models
  - Control: Category-1 metacognition involves coordinating lower level 
    behavioral-control systems (choosing between them (arbitrating), and 
    multitasking)

Consciousness (the most quintessentially 'meta' cognition)
o Consciousness is perceiving, pondering, and experiencing things derived from 
  other decision processes, making it metacognition
o The 'Hard Problem': explaining subjective human conscious experience 
  - The authors attempt to summarize the developments regarding consciousness:
    + Integrated Information Theory (IIT) as a theoretical framework
      - Starting with axioms about consciousness and deriving postulates from
        it
      - Central idea: must use own experiences of the phenomenon of 
        consciousness as proper representation of consciousness
    + For a system to have artificial consciousness, must observe the following:
      - External environment
      - Itself in relation to the environment
      - Internal thoughts
      - Time (past, present, potential future)
      - Hypothetical or imaginative thoughts 
      - Reflection (observation of observation)
    + The authors conclude that to meet these requirements, an AI system would 
      simply have to create and process data structures to represent them.
      MG> They do seem to imply that in actuality, it would not be so simple. 
          However, how would a data structure allow a machine to create 
          imaginative thoughts? That seems to be too abstract a concept to be 
          simple to implement.
o The authors mention Dehaene's idea that consciousness is the mind's VR, that 
  allows for the stable retention of information while perception is ever 
  changing
o Another aspect of consciousness: inner speach and an interpreter
  - Interpreter: consciousness gives us the sense that we are in control, and
    gives us a sense of "I" (which, as we know, are Gazzaniga's words)
    + In the context of metacognition, this interpreter role of consciousness 
      organizes lower level processes to produce a consistent narrative, and
      this narrative is used to affect behavior
      - In this way, consciousness is related to all 3 types of metacognition, 
        as it coordinates other systems, and makes decisions
o Johnson-Laird discussed a parallel approach to artificial consciousness 
o Affective processing was identified as an important part of conscious 
  experience:
  - Our experience of consciousness and sentience is at least partially due 
    to an integrated signal of bottom-up body state signals and top-down
    conceptual understanding
    MG> Perhaps because I don't have the background to understand this, but 
        I feel the authors could have been clearer about how the combination 
        of such signals contributes to sentience. 
  - Metacognition should play an important part in further understanding 
  consciousness, as it focuses on system-wide integration of cognitive 
  processing

6. Design Issues and Case Studies

6.1 Design Issues for Metacognition

The homunculus fallacy: a little person (homunculus) inside one's brain can 
reason like an intelligent being, implying it has a mind and another little
person inside it - an infinite train of thought 
o Possible solution: provide constraints on what the highest level system should
  entail 
  - Functional standpoint: conceive metacognition holistically rather than 
    part of collection of parts 

Internal languages of thought:
o One general approach for building a metacognitive system: build additional 
  components for the model, or make the system itself able to add a process
o A logical hierarchy has been developed that can connect the lower end of the
  decision with higher end of perception, providing a step in facilitating
  metacognition 

Limitations of human cognition: human cognition often makes simple logical 
errors, and perhaps should not be the only model for metacognition

6.2 Metacognition in Cognitive Architectures 

o Three case studies for metacognition using computational frameworks: ACT-R,
  CLARION, and LIDA
o ACT-R
  - There is a metacognitive module that accesses the model's knowledge and uses 
    it to solve a problem
o CLARION
  - Comprises of symbolic and subsymbolic representation levels
  - Based on model describing metacognition as monitoring and coordination of 
    cognitive processes in relation to the data they use
    MG> Symbolic: more useful for coding, explaining. Subsymbolic: better 
        performance, not formatted for humans
o LIDA
  - Doesn't define metacognition outright with a certiain module; instead 
    metacognition emerges from the interaction of cognitive cycles 
    corresponding to action-perception loops
  - Implemented through behavior streams, each with its own metacognitive task
  - Uses an artificial consciousness system where little processes (attention
    codelets) compete to bring items of interest to consciousness

--- BEGIN about 2010 Cognition article Mapping Introspection's Blind Spot
 
Mapping introspection's blind spot: Reconstruction of dual-task phenomenology
using quantified introspection
 
o Overview of the experiment:
  - The authors performed a psychological refractory experiment, comparing
   objective responses to the subjective, introspective responses of the subjects
   + They found introspections to be highly correlated with objective measures
   + However, whenever the second target was presented while the first task
     was being completed, subjects were largely unaware of them: this was the
     psychological refractory period effect
 
o Figure Three:
  - (A) Representation of the central bottleneck model
   + While the central stage of T1 is occurring, T2 processing cannot occur
   + The central stage of T2 begins at the end of T1 decision no matter when
     T2 onset occurs
   MG> It looks like the so-called "bottleneck" is that only one thing may be
       in the central stage at once. One thing I don't understand is how, if T1
       and T2 are perceived/onset at the same time, the brain determines
       whether T1 or T2 is processed (via the Central stage) first
  - (B) Objective response times as a function of SOA
   + SOA is stimulus onset asynchrony, or the amount of time between the
     starts of stimuli
   + As the SOA increases, the reaction time seems to decrease
   MG> This makes sense in light of (A). When the SOA is very small, it's
       likely that the central stage of T1 is still occurring, and thus the
       reaction time for T2 would be longer
- (C) Subjective phenomenology of a PRP trial based on introspective measures
   + PRP: psychological refractory period (time during which the response to
     a second stimulus is significantly slowed because a first stimulus is
     still being processed.)
   + In most cases, the objective SOA matches what participants reported.
     Participants seemed blind to T2's onset during processing of T1 
   MG> When comparing (C) to (A), it's easy to see the PRP. Even when the SOA
       was 0, the participants seemed to think T2 appeared much after T1. This
       shows very clearly the idea that our brains are like a bottleneck, only
       able to process one thing at a time

o Methods:
    - First, had subjects undergo "calibration" which entailed responding to a 
      tone and estimating timing repeatedly
    - Then had subjects respond as quickly as possible to an auditory tone (T1) 
      by pressing one of two keys corresponding with a low tone and a high tone, 
      followed by a visual letter (T2) by pressing one of two keys corresponding 
      with one of two possible letters
        + The subjects were told to respond first to the tone, then to the
          letter (this answers my question from last week about how they 
          were to differentiate which was T1 and T2 and which to process first)
        + Subjects then had to answer four introspective question regarding:
            - Time to respond to T1 (auditory tone)
            - Time to respond to T2 (visual stimulus)
            - Stimulus onset asynchrony
            - Whether the letter appeared before or after the auditory decision

o Overall Conclusions:
    - With regards to the objective measures, the experiments demonstrated all 
      of the properties of the PRP phenomenon, meaning at short SOAs, processing 
      of T1 delayed processing of T2
    - Subjectively, subjects underreported reaction times, suggesting they 
      introspect about only part of the total processing time
        + Subjects showed an inability to introspect about the T2 duration
          when occupied with the first
    - The authors also conclude that introspection is a tool that can provide 
      data about the subjective phenomenology of a task, whether or not it is 
      objectively true
o AC> Does this study conflict with the concept of attentional blink?
    - Marti et al. describe the dual-task paradigm as something allowing us to
      monopolize our attention on a task, leaving other tasks with few 
      attentional resources, to the point where perception is delayed and the
      subjective timing is off.
    - Attentional blink (AB) occurs when the perception of the second target does 
      not occur at all when the two target onsets are very close
        + This might seem to conflict with the results of this study, where it 
          appears that subjects merely experienced a delay in CON, but they 
          did perceive the second target
    - Marti et al., however, decide that the central interference model and the 
      attentional blink model do not conflict, but are in fact related.
        + AB can occur under appropriate conditions for masking, leading not 
          just to delayed perception but an inability to achieve CON at all. 
        + The conditions necessary for this to occur when the targets are
          embedded in a temporal series of distractors.
            - Some reports have shown that distractors that occur after the 
              onset of T2 can cause the distortion of perception
        + Some have even said that the PRP (psychological refractory period) 
          and AB models should be combined into one
    MG> It seems that most researchers agree that attentional blink and the
    models/findings of this paper are not conflicting, but in fact share many
    commonalities. My conclusion is that this study did not create the 
    appropriate conditions for the AB phenomenon to occur, namely using
    distractors both before and after T2.

o AC> Why is the personal pronoun “I” ambiguous in situations when we are sure of 
  the identity of the person using that pronoun?
  MG> I'm still a little confused about this question in the context of the 
      paper. The paper seems to conclude that one's introspective reports, while
      not necessarily always objectively true, can reveal things about what is
      going on in the mind. Perhaps when a person uses the word "I" and is
      reflecting introspectively, they aren't actually reporting on their actual
      state but rather, what they think their state is?

--- BEGIN about Wikipedia article on Benjamin Libet

Life Overview

o Libet was a scientist studying consciousness, and received the Virtual Nobel
  Prize in Psychology for his work involving consciousness and free will
o His most famous work involved unconscious electrical processes in the brain
  that precede conscious decisions, suggesting that these unconscious processes
  potentially cause volitional acts
    - This work is controversial as it challenges the belief in free will, and
      also because of some of its implicit assumptions

Volitional acts and readiness potential

o Equipment used:
  - Cathode ray oscilloscope was used as a timer to determine the amount of time
    between the subject's conscious will to act and the action itself
  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to monitor brain activity
  - Electromyograph (EMG) was used to record muscle movement during the 
    voluntary motor act
o Methods:
  - Subjects sat infront of the timer with EEG electrodes attached
  - Subjects would be asked to perform a motor activity like pressing a button
  - Subjects were to note the position of the oscilloscope when they became 
    aware of the urge to act (this was used as the time of initial volition)
    MG> The article mentions that subjects were able to report this fairly
        accurately. However, it seems to me like there would be issues with 
        delay (because as we've learned, the mind takes time to take in 
        sensory input and process it). 
  - The position of the oscilloscope when the button was pressed was recorded 
    (this was used as the time of the motor activity)
  - The brain activity from the EEG recordings was compared with the timing of
    initial volition
      + Researchers found that brain activity related to the action began as 
        many as 300ms before subjects reported awareness of the will to act, 
        meaning conscious decisions were apparently proceeded by an unconscious 
        buildup of activity in the brain
          - This is referred to as Bereitschaftspotential or readiness 
            potential
          - The outcome of a decision could be predicted by studying brain 
            activity in the prefontal and parietal cortex up to 7 seconds before 
            the subject was aware of their decision

Implications

o Some interpret Libet's experiments to mean that it is these unconscious 
  processes that are the true initiators of volitional acts, rather than free 
  will
o Libet himself believes that free will plays a part in 'the power of veto'
  - Conscious acquiescence is required to allow the readiness potential to be
    actualized into movement
  - For example, the suppression of anger is an example of the conscious will
    suppressing something brought on by the unconscious
  MG> This is fascinating to me. I've never before considered what physically
      or chemically is happening when anger surges within a person. I guess
      that would be an unconscious feeling, and the consciousness must decide
      whether to act upon it or suppress it. I have a close friend who 
      struggles with anger issues, sometimes over small things, and this really
      makes me think about why some people to have more trouble with unwanted 
      surges of anger, as it frames this anger as an unconscious phenomenon.
o Reactions by dualist philosophers 
  - Some dualist philosophers have disputed the idea that consciousness is a 
    side effect of neuronal functions, which Libet's experiments seem to support
      + They suggest that consciousness is something additional to neuronal 
        activity
  - Others criticize the setup of the experiment, specifically asking the 
    subjects to wait for the urge to appear to move, as this is not a conscious
    act
o David Dennett criticizes the fact that while some portions of the experiment
  were timed objectively (using the EEG), others were subjective (like the 
  subject's report of the position of the oscilloscope hand)
    - He argues that the subject's subjective report describes when things
      came together, rather than when they objectively occur
        + He points out that the time taken for the light from the 
          oscilloscope to travel from the subject's retina to the cortex is
          not taken into account, and that these visual signals need to be 
          processed before the subject can make a conscious decision
o Libet also argued that his experiments suggested humans retrospectively
  date the beginning of a sensation to the moment of primary neuronal response
    - This idea was met with controversy

Conscious mental field theory
o Libet proposed a theory of the conscious mental field (CMF) explaining how 
  mental arises from the physical brain
  - He proposed the CMF as a "property" of the brain that explains the 
    following:
    + The unity of subjective conscious experience (why even though functions of
      the cortex are localized to a microscopic level, our conscious experiences
      are a single unified experience)
    + The phenomenon that conscious mental function appears to influence nerve 
      cell activity
  - The CMF is the mediator between physical activities of nerve cells and the
    emergence of subjective experience
    + It cannot exist without the brain, but it has properties not directly
      predictable from the activities of the physical neurons

Introduction
 
o Discusses prehistoric depictions of dreaming, and the recurring symbolic
  use of birds as representations of souls flying away from physical bodies
  - Dreaming potentially is proof that mental activity is more than the
    physical world
    + The author wonders-how can a mind, which is "free-flying", arise from
      a down to earth, or material brain?
 
Descarte's Challenge
 
o Descartes described dualism-the idea that the conscious mind is made of
  nonmaterial substance, and eludes the laws of physics, that no machine could
  ever emulate the free flowing mind
  -   Many people, textbooks, etc. believe that Descartes set back neuroscience
  -   The author argues that the "truth" is Descartes was a pioneer, and his
      ideas were the first in synthetic biology and theoretical modeling
 
o Descartes described the human body as a machine-similar to an instrument,
  with pipes and fluids called "animal spirits".  This machine has functions
  such as digestion, nourishment, hear beating, waking, sleeping, smell,
  light detection, as well as impression of ideas in "the organ of common
  sense and imagination", and the retention of ideas in memory, and the
  functioning is similar to/as natural as a clock's ticking or some sort of
  mechanical system.
  MG> I find it fascinating to see the contrast between how insightful
      some of his ideas are (such as memories being pathways, which is
      reminiscent of modern ideas about changes in brain connections and
      neurons) and how absurd others are (like the often referenced
      "animal spirits" which can be a mechanism in moving a limb or, when the
      pressure of spirits is reduced, causing sleep)
 
o Although (as described above) Descartes did believe the mind (or some
  functions of the mind) to be part of the bodily machine, he still believed
  that some portion of it was immaterial. Two of its functions made him
  particularly believe minds to be something no machine could ever replicate:
  - Expressing thoughts/ideas through words, and responding to queries
  MG> This is really interesting, because it seems like a lot of
      the latest technology (e.g. Amazon echo, Google Assistant, etc.) is
      able to "understand" and respond quite appropriately to human speech. I
      recently saw a video about something called Google Duplex, during which
      the assistant made a call to book a haircut appointment, which was
      astonishing to watch, but raised a lot of questions about potential
      implications of such realistic AI.  It's strange to think about what
      Descartes would think about a machine replicating human interaction so
      accurately.
   - Flexible reasoning-Descartes believed machines behave rigidly, and
     cannot generate infinite variety of thoughts/react to any possible
     occurrence in life
 
The Last Problem
 
o While far away galaxies and tiny particles have been studied extensively,
  the brain and consciousness have not
o In the 80s, the word was even "banned" - psychologists felt it added little
  - This book tells the story about how this attitude changed, and
    consciousness became a focus of neuroscience
 
Cracking Consciousness
 
o Definition of consciousness- 3 parts:
  - State of wakefulness
  - Focusing attention onto specific things
  - Conscious access (hereby abbreviated as CON)
    + The fact that some information enters our mind and awareness and
      becomes transferable to others
 
o Author argues that only CON is true consciousness, as one can see something
  flash before their eyes but not really process/see it (this is unconscious)
 
o CON can be studied scientifically-the author says there are "dozens of ways"
  stimuli can be perceived.
  MG> I wish the author would provide more information about how
      these stimuli are studied. In the next paragraph he details that
      higher-order consciousness (like the recursive nature of consciousness)
      can now be quantified, but doesn't discuss how. Although perhaps he
      will cover this more later.
 
o Some philosophers [AC: especially David Chalmers] claim consciousness and
  the way we perceive our world will never be described scientifically, but
  the author disagrees.
 
To See or Not to See
 
o The eye takes in a lot of things, but only some things make it to our minds,
  whereas others are lost (this is CON).
 
Turning Subjectivity into Science
 
o The author argues that subjective reports from patients are important in the
  study of CON as they correspond with real events in the brain.
 
Signatures of Conscious Thoughts
 
o Author's research uses brain scans to examine where in the brain is
  stimulated when a person perceives something.
  - He and colleagues have proposed "global neuronal workspace" -
    consciousness is sort of broadcast throughout a neuronal network
    throughout the brain.
    + This network is not traditional in the sense that it is active only when
      stimulated by some sort of input, but instead even in the dark, it
      remains active, broadcasting information throughout, causing the stream
      of consciousness.
 
The Future of Consciousness
 
o Applications of such research include determining whether patients in comas
  are conscious and simply unable to communicate that to us.
  - As well, could we replicate consciousness using computers?
    MG> I would love to learn more about new technologies such as AI and
        machine learning which attempt to model certain components of
        consciousness, especially as these topics are currently a "hot topic"
        of the technology industry.

Chapter 1: Consciousness Enters the Lab
 
o Optical illusions (such as the one on page 18) can allow researchers to
  track neural pathways during conscious vs unconscious stimuli, as right
  before our eyes things can disappear and reappear.
 
The Many Facets of Consciousness
 
o Even though we are constantly receiving endless stimuli -- colors, sounds,
  objects across the room -- only one single thread of consciousness is
  present in our brains. Our consciousness filters out all the extraneous
  information (this is CON).
  - The author points out that one is always *subconsciously* aware of the
    position of one's legs and pressure on certain body parts -- that
    information is always accessible, but not consciously on our minds.
    MG> I have noticed this phenomenon in the past, when for instance I become
        aware of the pace of my breath and the frequency of my blinking, but
        never considered it in this context before. There's so much that my
        body and brain process and do that I (if I can separate myself
        from these processes) am not consciously aware of!
 
o Selective attention and CON are different -- attention is not always
  conscious -- many times there is so much information that some attention
  must be given before deciding what to access.
 
o Another aspect of consciousness is vigilance -- described as "the level of
  excitement in cortical and thalamic networks that support conscious states",
  which is different than wakefulness.
  - Some people in vegetative states can be wakeful and yet not perceive any
    information.
 
o Consciousness has also been thought of as the ability to recognize
  oneself/have a sense of self (metacognition = "the ability to think about
  one's mind")
  - There are interesting experiments such as the red dot test (to see if
    children and animals recognize selves in the mirror), suggesting that
    humans are not alone in this type of consciousness.
    * The author says that the study of consciousness as a science should
      focus on CON as things like recursive consciousness, attention,
      wakefulness, and vigilance complicate things, and should be saved for
      later.
 
Minimal Contrasts
o Minimal contrast: a pair of experimental situations that are minimally
  different, but only one is consciously perceived.
  - Experiments that utilize this allow scientists to examine one variable,
    and exactly what events cause this switch from unaware to aware.
 
o The optical illusion where the grey dots disappear may be similar to the
  way our eyes must filter out blood vessels in front of photoreceptors
  MG> I've heard also in the past that we are constantly filtering out our
      nose from our field of sight as well. The depth to which our eyes and
      brain coordinate to create our field of vision astounds me!
 
Rival Images
 
o Binocular rivalry:
  - Our eyes notice two slightly different worlds, but our brains fuse this
    into one smooth view of the world
  - When Sir Charles Wheatstone [AC: 1838] did an experiment where each eye
    could see distinct images, the viewer's perception wavered between the
    two visions (the images "fight" for conscious perception).
 
o  In experiments involving monkeys, at earlier processing stages, cells
   acted objectively (firing regardless of whichever image the monkey
   indicated they perceived), whereas as visual processing progressed to
   "higher visual areas", neurons began to agree with what was consciously
   perceived, suggesting conscious perception relies on higher level
   association cortex.
 
When Attention Blinks
 
o The binocular rivalry requires attention -- once attention is removed, the
  rivaling neurons no longer act codependently.
 
o Attentional blink: by saturating the mind, there are brief periods of
  invisibility where the brain does not perceive certain things.
  - In one study, stream of symbols appears on computer screen, most digits,
    some are letters. Viewers are told to remember the letters, and if the
    second letter appears very close to the first, they are often unaware
    + Brain imaging reveals that viewers see all letters, but not all reach
      the processing that makes us aware
 
o Similar to binocular rivalry in that two images are competing, but instead
  these are temporally separated.
 
o Even if we think we can process multiple unrelated things at once, that is
  an illusion (CON has a [AC: SEQUENTIAL] bottleneck)
  - There's a refractory period, a delay period before further inputs are
    processed, which we are unaware of.
 
o Longer term, this phenomenon is known as "inattentional blindness" (like
  when a chess player is oblivious to his surroundings, and the invisible
  gorilla experiment)
 
o Change blindness- inattention making us unaware of significant changes (like
  the WHODUNNIT experiment)
 
Masking Conscious Perception
 
o Masking, or subliminal images:
  - For scientific studies, need to be able to make an image 100% invisible,
    no matter how informed participants are or how many times they view it.
  - Masking can do this -- images sandwiched between other images are
    "masked".
 
Primacy of the Subjective
o The author argues that subjective reports can be trusted, and form the
  primary data that should be recorded.
  - In his experiments, he found participants' introspection about whether
    they perceived an image consistent with their naming/memory abilities.
  - He concedes that introspection can be problematic, however
  - Neuroscientists must examine which neurobiological events contribute to
    subjective experience.
Chapter 2: Fathoming Unconscious Depths
 
Pioneers of the Unconscious
 
o Many philosophers spoke of the concept that much of our mental processing
  occurs outside of our consciousness.
 
The Seat of Unconscious Operations
 
o There were many theories regarding what parts of the brain correspond to
  conscious vs unconscious thought, but it's now known that virtually all
  regions participate in both types.
 
o Blindsight: patients with lesions on visual cortex behave as though blind in
  specific parts of visual field, but can still "blindly" point to sources of
  light (unconscious vision)
  - Research on patients with brain lesions suggested unconscious images are
    processed in the cortex
 
The Brain's Dark Side
 
o Subliminal priming:
  - Flashing subliminal word ("prime") (unconsciously) before another visible
    item ("target")
    + When the prime is the same word, the processing of the word is much
      faster, even when the case of the words is different.
    + Even though the first word is unconscious, the brain processes the
      fact that "radio" and "RADIO" are the same word
    + This experiment demonstrated that the ventral route (which processes
      the identity of pictures and words) also participates in unconscious
      processing, thus both routes (ventral and dorsal) can operate below
      conscious experience
 
Binding Without Consciousness
 
o Previous ideas that consciousness is needed to bind together individual
  elements of a visual scene disproven by the subliminal priming experiment,
  as "range" as a prime for "anger" did not have the same effect as "range"
  as a prime for "range" (meaning the subconscious was able to process and
  bind the letters in these words).
 
o Behind the scenes, our brains are constantly working to transform the light
  that enters our retinas into a 3D scene
 
         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8
12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
 
 
 
Playing Chess Unconsciously
 
o Our brains can, in a fraction of a second, see an image and parse the
information without our knowledge
   - A chess expert can have an image of a chessboard flashed before their
     eyes and have it influence their decision
   - The optical illusion on page 61 shows how almost instantly, our brain
     parses the objects in the image and makes sense of it, all unconsciously
 
Seeing Voices
 
o Consciousness isn't even required to fuse visual and auditory signals!
o McGurk effect:
   - Video sounds like "da da da". If you close your eyes, it sounds like "ba
     ba ba". Visually, the mouth says "ga ga ga". The brain unconsciously makes
     sense of these conflicting signals by combining the sounds.
   MG> This is astounding to me, simply because even when one tries to hear
       the correct sound while watching the video, it is near impossible. Even
       when consciously aware of the effect, we can't prevent our brains from
       doing this processing!
o Wolf Singer suggested that there are two types of binding (of information):
   - Routine bindings that are coded by dedicated neurons committed to
     specific combinations of inputs
       + For example, our cortex likely has neurons dedicated to letter
         strings like "un", "the", and "tion"
   - Nonroutine bindings spawned by unforeseen combinations (may require a
     more conscious state)
 
Unconscious Meaning
 
o There has been controversy over whether a word's meaning can be processed
without consciousness, especially as consciousness and comprehension are so
 closely connected
   - "Cocktail party" effect: when you are in a room with dozens of
     conversations, you can focus in on one conversation, and unattended voices
     are blocked. However, why is it that if one of those unattended voices
     says your name, you will hear and respond?
       + Some believe that your brain unconsciously processes the unattended
         voices
       + Others may argue that your consciousness actually switches back and
         forth very quickly
   - The author says that the consensus now is that the unconscious mind
     proposes while the conscious mind selects:
       + Consider the word "bank", which can be a financial institution or a
         river bank
       + When a prime word (like bank) is masked down to the unconscious
         level, "money" and "water" are primed, meaning our unconscious mind
         stores all meanings, (while our conscious mind selects)
 
The Great Unconscious Wars
 
o There remained controversy over unconscious semantic processing, but even
 after taking greater care to make sure experiments were performed well, the
 results confirmed that words, digits, and pictures can be unconsciously
 processed
   - Anthony Greenwald demonstrated that emotion cuold be activated
     unconsciously (when prime words were congruent or incongruent with the
     word shown, participants performed better on congruent trials)
o However, this was later discredited (by Greenwald himself), as the
 priming, while subliminal, bypassed meaning and had to do more with the
 shallow association between sets of letters and their corresponding response
 
Unconscious Arithmetic
 
o Dehaene did a similar experiment, but with numbers instead of words. This
 involved flashing 1, 4, 6, or 9 and then showing a number, and asking whether
 the number shown is > or < than 5. The invisible numbers caused semantic
 priming
   - Whether the prime was 'four' or '4' didn't matter, suggesting that the
     effect was due to meaning rather than visual shapes
   - Activity in left and right parietal lobes, the "number sense" regions of
     the brain, decreased when the same number was displayed twice
     ("repetition suppression")
 
Combining Concepts Without Consciousness
 
o Brain imaging done on epileptic patients showed that the amygdala (which)
processes emotion, fires signals for words that were invisible to the patient
o N400 wave - brain wave that marks the brain's response to an unexpected
 meaning (whose size corresponds with the degree of absurdity)
   - This occurs even for words we don't see (because of masking or
     inattention)
   - The size of N400 is the same whether the words are conscious or invisible
o The author concludes that invisible words can elicit activation in meaning
networks, but unconscious activity is confined to a narrow brain circuit
 
Attentive but Unconscious
 
o Attention doesn't require awareness-our minds are not constantly examining
 everything around us and deciding what to focus on. Instead, this occurs
sub rosa, in parallel.
o This filter is "selective attention"
   - Loud noises and blinking lights can disrupt this, as they represent
     dangers
o "Attention can amplify a visual stimulus and still leave it too weak to
 break into our awareness" (76)
MG> I don't quite understand what Dehaene is saying here. How can one focus
     their attention on something if they can't even see it consciously?
o Conscious intentions can affect unconscious attention.
   - For example, if you're shown a set of shapes and told to detect the
     squares, and a square and circle appear (masked), something called N2pc
     (a marker of parietal lobe activation) shows an unconscious orientation
     towards the square
 
The Value of an Invisible Coin
 
o All the stimuli we receive is assigned a value by a set of neural networks
 within the basal ganglia
   - In one study, a picture of a penny or a pound coin was subliminally
     flashed, and although participants couldn't consciously see the image,
     their actions were influenced based on which image was flashed
   - Our brains unconsciously monitor the world around us and assign value to
     things. It is because of these tags that the most relevant events draw
     our attention
 
Unconscious Mathematics
 
o "We constantly overestimate our awareness--even when we are aware of the
 glaring gaps in our awareness."
   - Because we're not aware of our unconscious thoughts, we overestimate the
     degree to which our conscious thoughts influence us
o The mathemetician Henri Poincare made certain mathematical discoveries
 unconsciously - the idea would come to him when his mind was occupied by
 something else entirely
   MG> This is not altogether surprising to me. Sometimes the best cure for
   not knowing a solution to a problem is sleep. I have always wondered how
   sometimes letting my mind drift elsewhere can be the most useful way to
   solve a problem that has been bothering me.
o Dijksterhuis performed an experiment where participants had to choose the
 best car among four cars based on 12 criteria, and half were allowed to
 consciously think about their choice, while half were distracted. The
 "unconscious" decision group picked the best car 60% of the time, while the
 conscious group picked it 22% of the time.
   - The author says that some aspects of problem solving are better dealt
     mostly unconsciously
   MG> I'm not sure if I'm convinced that these examples show that largely
       unconscious decision making may sometimes be better. However,
       anecdotally speaking, I can agree with his statement.
   - One possible explanation is that the conscious group was too focused on
     a couple of the criteria, and weren't able to see the big picture, whereas
     unconscious processes excel at assigning values to many items and
     averaging them
o Dehaene provides examples of experiments where the subconscious is  
   somewhat able to average the number of arrows pointing to the right out of
   an image containing five arrows even when they aren't consciously able to
   see the arrows
 
Statistics During Sleep
 
o Dehaene describes an experiment in which participants had to perform a long
calculation, but there was a pattern in the numbers that, when discovered,
 allowed them to save time and effort. The researchers found that after a
 night of sleep, many participants woke up with the shortcut in mind.
   - During sleep, neurons in the hippocampus and cortex are active, and
     replay in fast forward the same sequences of activity from periods of
     wakefulness
   MG> I wonder if this is the reason why sometimes after performing a
   repetitive and/or mentally tasking task all day, I have dreams about that
   doing that same task. It's interesting to consider this phenomenon in terms
   of the neurons "replaying" the sequences that occurred during the day
 
A Subliminal Bag of Tricks
 
o Psychology has demontrated that subliminal perception exists, and that many
 processes can run without consciousness
o Some even argue that the subliminal self may be superior to the conscious
 self
   - Many say that the mental operations underlying our decisions are
     unconscious, and our consciousness is a bystander
o In the next chapter, Dehaene will refute this "zombie" theory, arguing that
 consciousness is an evolved feature with a use
 
Chapter 3: What is Consciousness Good for?
 
o Consciousness is stable, while subliminal information is quickly fading.
Consciousness also compresses information into small, bite sized pieces,
 whereas subliminal information is large and ever changing
 
o Darwin's ideas about natural selection overturned previous ideas that every
 feature had a specific function for a specific purpose (teleology)
   - Several other ideas also go along with this theory:
       + Spontaneous pattern generation: certain chemical reactions can cause
         organized features like zebra stripes and melon ribs
       + Allometric relations: some features that may not seem evolutionarily
         advantageous, like the Irish elk's huge horns, may have been due to an
         increase in the overall size of the organism, which would provide
         evolutionary advantage
       + Spandrels: features of organisms that don't seem advantageous may
         have arisen as a byproduct of its architecture (for instance, the male
         nipple is an outcome of the development of the advantageous
         female breasts)
o This means that consciousness cannot be thought of as necessarily having a
 specific benefit or purpose
   - Dehaene questions whether consciousness is a mere byproduct
       + We could perform many of our cognitive functions just as well
         as unconscious zombies
       + "User illusion": our feeling of being in control may be fallacious
   - Dehaene chooses to explore the functionalist view, which is that
     consciousness is useful, and that it has been selected over millions of
     years because it serves a role
 
Unconscious Statistics, Conscious Sampling
 
o Dehaene describes our mind's processing as a division of labor: there are
 myriad levels below that do the tedious work of creating the most complete
 interpretation of our environment, whereas our consciousness exists a level
 above, like executives making high level decisions
   - Consciousness is what allows us to make decisions, and what prevents us
     from becoming like the donkey that died standing between a pail of water
     and a stack of hay
o Bayesian influence: using statistical reasoning in a backwards manner to
 infer the hidden causes behind our observations
   - There's a theory that the brain acts in this way (backwards)
       + In perceiving a plate as a circle, and not an ellipse, for example,
         the brain has weeded out a vast array of other explanations
       + Each individual neuron suffers from the "aperture problem" (viewing
         a stick through a peephole doesn't allow you to see its true motion);
         however, we do not see this ambiguity, as our brains let us see the
         most likely interpretations. This process takes time, but we only
         perceive the end result.
       MG> Dehaene talks about how this ability of our neurons to agree on a
           single interpretation disappears when someone is under anesthesia.
           How do they know this? I wish he'd go into more detail here.
       + In an experiment showing two superimposed gratings (a visual
         ambiguity), our perception changes every few seconds. What we see is
         the most likely interpretation, but other possibilities pop up
         sometimes, for a duration proportional to their statistical
         likelihood. "Our unconscious perception works out the possibilities--
         and then our consciousness samples from them at random." This seems
         only to occur when conscious attention is focused on the input.
o Overall theme: unconscious processes are fast and parallel, whereas
 consciousness is the slow sampler
 
Lasting Thoughts
 
o Working memory: the part of short term memory focused on immediate conscious
perception and linguistic processing
   - Associated with the prefrontal cortex
   - Consciousness may have had a specific evolutionary role: learning over
     time, rather than just living in the instant
       + The eye-closure reflex experiment (a loud noise coincides with or
         is followed by a burst of air to the eye) demonstrates that
         coincidence based conditioning is unconscious, while memory-trace
         learning requires being aware of the predictive link
o The duration of a visible image in our brains is much higher than those made
invisible by masking (to the point where after around a second, unconscious
 activation is undetectable)
   - Only consciousness allows for lasting thoughts
 
The Human Turing Machine
 
o Performing multidigit arithmetic allows us to recite the "algorithm" our
 minds used. Dehaene says that performing complex strategies using multiple
 steps (algorithms) is a uniquely evolved function of consciousness
   - "The conscious brain operates as a biological Turing machine"
       + He qualifies this by saying that while this applies when the brain
         is engaged in long calculations, the brain itself is radically
         different from modern computers
o While our unconscious minds can access a wide array of information, our
 conscious brains are needed to act on this information in certain ways
 (calculations, using certain strategies, etc.)
   - We need consciousness to rationally think about problems. The
     unconscious generates hunches, whereas only the conscious can go through
     step by step

A Social Sharing Device

o Consciousness is a means through which to transfer information between people
  in a condensed manner
    - One important component of this communication is the ability to relay our 
      confidence in/the reliability of our knowledge
        + This helps us to make decisions (through weighing each source of 
          information by reliability), and compare our knowledge with others to 
          perform collective decision making
    - The brain contains structures that accumulate our self-knowledge and
      information about others, representing "onself as another"
      MG> I wonder if this is in any way related to the question posed about 
          "I" being ambiguous. On a (somewhat) related note, many times I find
          myself in my inner dialogue talking to myself in the second person, as
          if I were another person talking to myself. In that sense I could see 
          the usage of "I" being a little off as well.

Chapter 4: The Signatures of a Conscious Thought

o In 1990, fMRI technology allowed the brain's activity to be observed by
  tracking red blood cell movement through hemoglobin molecules
    - Electroencephalography recording of brain waves also provide recordings of
      brain activity

The Avalanche of Consciousness

o In multiple experiments, when the conscious threshold was passed, brain 
  activity surged in higher visual centers (behaving like a sort of avalanche)
    - When crossing the conscious threshold, an amplification of brain activity
      occurs, progressively gathering strength and invading multiple regions of 
      the brain including the parietal and prefontal circuits (signature 1)

Timing the Conscious Avalanche

o In 1995 Dehaene performed an experiment where he was able to isolate the
  timing of CON
    - Words were flashed at the exact moment of attentional blink, such that
      viewers missed half of the words. This allowed Dehaene to observe the 
      differences in brain waves between words where CON was achieved or wasn't
    - Around 200-300ms after the onset, brain activity in unconscious trials 
      faded, while in conscious trials it progressed to the front of the brain, 
      producing an avalanche that is picked up by markers, known as the P3 wave
      (signature 2)
o Whenever the parietal and prefontal lobes are processing a stimulus, they
  then can't process a second. Sometimes we do perceive it, but after a delay.
  This is the PRP (that is examined in the 2010 Marti et al. paper)

Consciousness Lags Behind the World

o Our consciousness lags by at least 1/3 of a second, moreso when we are 
  distracted. However, we have certain mechanisms that help us cope with this:
    - Sometimes we act on "auto-pilot", like when our finger retracts from a 
      hot surface before we're consciously aware of it
    - Anticipation: we perceive predictable stimuli sooner than unpredictable
      ones
o In cases where people are told to move their eyes away from a flash of light
  (counter to the usual reaction), at first, their eyes are magnetically 
  attracted to the light. Only after this initial response does the conscious
  response occur, a response indistinguishable from the aforementioned P3 wave.

Isolating the Conscious Moment

o To fully isolate CON and equalize all other factors, a trial must equalize
  the stimuli and responses, such that everything is identical except the 
  subjective feeling of conscious vision
    - Salti did just that, and confirmed that the P3 wave is a signature of
      conscious access
        + Utilized blind sight - responses where they were unaware of any
          stimuli, but still responded correctly - this meant that the stimuli
          and response was the same. The only difference was the P3 wave,
          which was much larger on conscious trials

Igniting the Conscious Brain

o "Global ignition" - the term for the large-scale activity pattern response
  in the brain to stimuli
    - Neurons excite one another in a similar manner to the way applause bursts
      from a crowd, and once the excitation exceeds a threshold, it becomes
      self-reinforcing, meaning neurons excite other neurons that return the 
      excitation
o Dehaene performed an experiment varying the SOA between a short stimuli
  followed by a mask of random letters. As the SOA increased continuously,
  visibility did not increase continuously; instead there was a threshold of 
  50 ms. The P3 wave once again corresponded with reports of CON

Deep Inside the Conscious Brain

o Experiments on epileptic patients confirmed this "global ignition" theory
    - Unconscious information is confined to a narrow circuit, whereas conscious
      information is distributed to larger areas for extended periods. Conscious
      words resulted in gamma rhythms (high frequency oscillations) persisting 
      much longer than unconscious words (signature 3).

The Brain Web

o Fourth signature: massive synchronization of electromagnetic signals across
  the cortex
    - This synchronization allows for the facilitation of information spread
    - While invisible images create only temporary synchrony, conscious images
      create an exchange of reciprocal signals called a "brain web"

The Tipping Point and Its Precursors

o Summary:
    - Conscious perception is a result of a wave of neuronal activity, exceeding
      the cortex's threshold for ignition
    - This causes an avalanche of activity, igniting many regions to a state
      (consciousness) ~300ms after onset
    - The frontal regions of the brain are informed of sensory input in a bottom
      up manner, but sending projections in a top-down manner
    - The result is a "brain web" of synchronization with distributed activation
      in the frontal and parietal lobes, a P3 wave, gamma-band activation, and 
      synchronization across long distances
o Dehaene distinguishes between factors that correlate with CON (such as those
  signals that occur as early as 100ms after the stimulus onset, or even those 
  that appear beforehand), and those that actually play a hand in CON

Decoding a Conscious Thought

o Dehaene strives to separate "conscious code" from the "bells and whistles" 
  that are associated, which contains a full record of a person's experience
  - Our cortex takes all of the jigsaw puzzle pieces of information we receive
    and puts it together to make the smooth, unified world we perceive
    + This suggests that early visual responses can't contain the conscious 
      code, as processing must occur beforehand. This is likely why the 
      signatures of consciousness occur so late, and the "conscious code" is 
      likely within later brain activity
o Neuroscientist Quian Quiroga and his colleagues discovered neurons that
  react to specific images, places, or people, and that are activated only 
  when CON is achieved. 
  - Itzhak Fried developed electrodes that can record individual neurons
    + They found individual neurons can be selective to certain images. For 
      instance, there can be a single neuron that responds to Bill Clinton
    + At all times, millions of cells in the anterior temporal lobe are 
      activating in response to the scenes we see, forming the "code" that 
      Dehaene is looking for
    + These cells fired only when CON was achieved
    + These cells allowed for the subjective state of the mind to be derived 
      from its objective state
    MG> Perhaps I'm overestimating the importance of these findings, but it
        seems astonishing to me that these neuron firings that are able to 
        correlate exactly to an image/idea, and only when CON is achieved. It 
        seems to be exactly what Dehaene and others previously mentioned have
        been looking for, and to be frank I'm surprised it took Dehaene this 
        long to mention this topic. As well, I'm still a little confused about
        how the researchers would go about locating a neuron that corresponds
        with, for instance, the TV show the Simpsons. 
    + Dehaene quickly qualifies his statements by saying that no single cell
      is responsible for a conscious thought. Instead, millions of neurons 
      discharging together form macroscopic brain potentials that can be 
      picked up by electrodes (even outside the skull).
o The posterior cingulate region (an integration area located in the midline
  parietal cortex) contains activity that is stable over time, reproducible, 
  and demonstrates invariance over superficial changes:
  - The neural activity in this region evoked by a visual stimulus remains 
    stable even when the subject's eyes move

Inducing a Hallucination

o For these neurons to be fully considered a signature of consciousness,
  they must be shown to cause such consciousness (i.e. inducing such activity
  should cause our brains to create such visualizations)
  - This occurs when we dream, but this is still not causative
  - Two methods to stimulate the brain:
    + TMS, or transcranial magnetic stimulation. A battery delivers current that
      induces a magnetic field generating a discharge in the cortex. 
      - TMS can disrupt perception or even cause illusory experiences, 
        demonstrating a link between brain activity and conscious experience.
    + Stimulate neurons directly with electrodes placed inside the brain. 
      - Patients saw and heard vivid images and scenarios when neurons were
        stimulated. Depending on the location stimulated, these hallucinations 
        changed.
      - Local stimulation is not enough to achieve CON- the induced activity 
        must diffuse to higher cortical centers, creating the global brain web 
        that seems to cause CON

Destroying Consciousness

o In theory, by tampering with the global brain web, CON should be eradicated
  - This was demonstrated in an experiment using a dual TMS, in which one 
    pulse's effect was eradicated by a second pulse afterwards, showing that 
    the initial pulse itself didn't cause CON, and that the activation loop must
    reach the primary visual cortex before being perceived
o Dehaene discusses loops forming consciousness
  - A local loop occurs when area A speaks to area B, and B speaks back to A
  - Long distance or global loops bring in prefrontal and parietal regions
    + Dehaene believes these long distance loops result in CON

A Thing Which Thinks

o While science is far from able to recreate any scene in one's mind just by 
  stimulating exactly the right regions of the brain, Dehaene believes it may
  not be that far off. 
  - Scientists motivated by the desire to restore functions in blind and
    paralyzed people continue to progress

--- BEGIN Dehaene's mentions of Libet
o Dehaene does not cover Libet's experiment in depth, but discusses them in 
  relation to other topics:
  - On page 128, Dehaene discusses the fact the P3 wave (a signature of 
    consciousness) arises quite late after the stimulus
    + Under the Notes section, Dehaene discusses how Libet was the first to 
      discuss the idea that consciousness is delayed
      - Libet found that early event-related potentials are present on 
        unconscious trials
      - Dehaene says that Libet took his interpretations too far, citing his 
        mental fields and backwards time mechanism ideas
--- END Dehaene's mentions of Libet

Chapter 5: Theorizing Consciousness

o The signatures of consciousness above do not explain why the firing of 
  neurons might cause the perception of color, or motion. A framework explaining
  how mental events relate to brain activity and objective measurements is 
  needed.
o Developing a theory explaining how the brain leads to the mind requires 
  similar scientific efforts as those leading to our current understanding of
  matter
  - Dehaene and colleagues' global neuronal workspace theory aims to explain 
    how consciousness arises from the brain activity and why it exhibits the 
    aforementioned signatures of consciousness

Consciousness is Global Information Sharing

o Global neuronal workspace theory: consciousness is brain-wide information 
  sharing
  - A piece of information becomes conscious when it is stored in a specific 
    area that makes it available to the rest of the brain and high level 
    decision systems. This global workspace allows the brain to select relevant 
    information and disseminate it according to our goals (name it, 
    evaluate it, report on it etc.), long after the stimuli is over
  MG> It seems that Dehaene is not defining consciousness as clearly as 
      Tononi did. Would a computer model of the brain, that had a component
      that allowed a piece of information to be spread around to different
      areas of the model, be considered conscious?
  - This idea is built upon a multitude of earlier proposals from 
    philosophers and psychologists. 
    + Hippolyte Taine proposed a theater of consciousness that allows us to 
      hear only a single actor, with a massive support staff backstage. 
      - Problem with this theory: who is the audience? -> homunculus fallacy
      - Important concept: the "limited-capacity channel", or bottleneck,
        of consciousness (supported by attentional blink and the PRP)
    + Bernard Baar's version of the workspace model: the audience of the 
      workspace is not a little person, but other unconscious processors 
      that receive the broadcast message and act upon it, with collective 
      intelligence rising from the broad exchange of messages
    + Another metaphor: consciousness is a high-level supervision system that 
      controls the flow of information in the rest of the nervous system, and
      information becomes conscious whenever represented in this system
      - Not completely correct: some unconscious stimuli can partially trigger
        inhibitory or regulatory functions of supervisory system
      - Information reaching the conscious workspace is capable of regulating 
        our thoughts. What we are aware of drives our decisions -> feeling of 
        being in control

Beyond Modularity

o Implementing and reproducing the functioning of the brain in silicon 
  is not impossible in theory, but very difficult
  - Software is modular, and what is inside module cannot be shared with others
  - The human cortex has modular processors (sectors dedicated to a specific 
    process), but consciousness may have evolved to mitigate this modularity, 
    to share it across modules in the brain
    + Evolutionary advantage: decisions must use multiple sources of knowledge

An Evolved Communication Network

o The brain is made of elongated cells (neurons) with long axons, measuring
  up to meters in size
  - A neuron can send information to distant areas of the spinal cord to 
    move specific muscles
  - The cortex, the mantle forming the brain's surface, is made of dense 
    long-distance projection cells. Nerve cells shaped like pyramids 
    group their axons together to form cables that crisscross and send sensory
    information to a network of parietal, temporal, and prefrontal regions
o Not all areas of the brain are equally well connected
  - The visual area V1 establishes a small set of connections, primarily with 
    neighbors, so that early visual operations are encapsulated
o In the prefrontal cortex, neurons with long-distance axons connect to 
  parietal, temporal, and posterior areas. These regions are hubs of brain 
  connections
  - These regions are also connected to areas like the thalamus (involved with 
    attention and synchronization), basal ganglia (decision making), and the 
    hippocampus (memorization)
o This network of interconnected brain regions, involving primarily the 
  prefrontal and parietal lobes, is the same region that constitutes the first
  signature of conscious processing
  + The activation of these regions whenever a piece of information becomes
    conscious may be due to their long-distance connectivity that allows for the 
    broadcast of messages across long distances 
  + The pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex are larger than in the
    sensory cortex, and the layers II and III of the prefrontal cortex are 
    thicker
    - Dendrites in the prefrontal cortex, responsible for receiving information
      at a synapse, are much larger in the prefrontal cortex than in 
      posterior regions of the brain
    - The FoxP2 gene with mutations specific to the Homo lineage, is associated 
      with speech, and also includes genes responsible for building 
      neurons, dendrites, axons, and synapses
      + Human prefrontal neurons, due to FoxP2, may have around fifteen thousand
        spines, meaning they could be communicating with that many other neurons
      + This arrangement seems like it could allow information to be broadcast
        anywhere in the brain, should it be deemed important enough to enter
        the global neuronal workspace

Sculpting a Conscious Thought

o How does the neuronal workspace store the endless possibility of conscious
  thoughts/states?
  - The combinations of active and inactive neurons must be able to form 
    billions of different patterns
  - In 1949, Donald Hebb proposed the 'cell-assembly' idea, in which sets of 
    neurons remain activated long after external stimulus is gone. These 
    neurons form a closed system in which the neurons send each other 
    excitatory pulses. The possibility of many different local assemblies 
    in different places in the brain mean that billions of states can be 
    represented.
  - In 1959, John Selfridge introduced the "pandemonium" metaphor, in which 
    a hierarchy of "daemons", each of which proposes an interpretation of 
    an incoming image, each shouts their interpretation, allowing the 
    decision system to form an opinion on the incoming image
    + For example, three daemons shouting for the presence of eyes, nose, and
      hair would excite a fourth daemon coding for a face
    + In actuality, neural systems do not simply work in a feed-forward manner-
      the cortex contains bidirectional projections and loops (interconnected 
      neurons form cell assemblies like Hebb proposed)
  - These recurrent networks/cell assemblies converge to a consensus, creating
    a unified interpretation and suppressing alternate interpretations, 
    removing noisy bits and restoring missy bits of an image 
    + This has been called a "neural coalition" by Crick and Koch, the "perfect
      vehicle for conscious representation"
      - When processing images, we do not perceive the components separately, 
        even though they are initially processed by a distinct group of neurons

o How do the distinct portions of an image (processed separately) get 
  attached to one another to form the single image we perceive?
  - Formation of global assembly, or "convergence zones", in the prefrontal 
    cortex, as well as the anterior temporal lobe, inferior parietal lobe, and a
    midline region called the precuneus, which send and receive projections 
    to and from a variety of brain regions, allowing the brain to converge 
    onto a single coherent interpretation. This interpretation might 
    be broadcast to areas where the sensory signal arose. This global 
    broadcasting results in the emergence of a single integrated and 
    differentiated state of consciousness.
    + This back-and-forth communication is called "reentry"
    MG> I'm not sure why this would be called reentry- is it the fact that 
        the interpretation is broadcast back to the sensory areas? I don't 
        quite understand what is "reentering."

The Shape of an Idea

o Dehaene's global neuronal workspace theory builds upon the ideas of the last
  section, proposing that a conscious state is encoded by the stable 
  activation of a subset of workspace neurons distributed in many brain areas,
  which exchange messages, and that CON is achieved when the messages converge 
  to a single interpretation
  - Neuronal synchrony is a key piece of this. Although in the absence of 
    consciousness, cell assemblies might synchronize locally, only with the 
    prefrontal cortex can the message be shared broadly and become conscious
o At any given moment, a single object of thought becomes the focus of our
  consciousness, and all the relevant neurons activate. The neurons that are 
  silent also encode information, signaling that their preferred feature is 
  not present
  MG> We discussed in our last meeting the fact that in Woody, the '0' bit 
      has just as much meaning as a '1' bit. This is very similar- an inactive
      neuron conveys information about the idea encoded by the state of the 
      brain, just as an activated neuron does.
o This idea of active and inactive neurons can also help explain the second
  signature of consciousness, the P300 wave, which is the large positive 
  voltage that peaks at the top of the scalp. Active neurons send signals down
  their long axons, where most of them meet inhibitory neurons that suppress 
  signals which encode for irrelevant things.
  - The layout of the cells is such that in active neurons, signals travel from
    superficial dendrites inwards to the cell bodies. These neurons are parallel
    to each other, such that their electrical currents add up, creating a 
    negative region. However, the inhibited neurons, which are much more 
    dominant, create a positive potential, and the positive voltages form a 
    large positive wave above the head- the P300 wave. 
  MG> This explains so much more about why and how the P300 wave occurs. Before
      Dehaene made this clear, it was quite hard to connect this abstract idea 
      a wave of a certain frequency with CON. Knowing the mechanism behind it
      is extremely helpful in both conceptualizing and understanding this 
      second signature.
  - The P300 indicates what the current thought is not about, which is why it 
    is strong and reproducible.
    + Vogel and colleagues experimentally showed negative voltages that 
      corresponded with the contents of working memory. These voltages 
      lasted as long as the objects were kept in mind, and increased when more
      objects were added to memory.

Simulating a Conscious Ignition

o While the metaphorical vision of global neuronal workspace theory helps our 
  intuition about what consciousness is, a mathematical theory should 
  replace it
  - Changeux and Dehaene have begun to develop simulations of neural networks
    that capture CON
    + They created a model that uses equations to mimic the spiking of nerve 
      cells, with each neuron having synapses and parameters representing 
      major types of receptors for neurotransmitters in the brain, and with 
      neurons organized into neuronal columns similar to those existing 
      biologically. The model also included a small thalamus connected to 
      cortical locations, generating a model of the thalamocortical column, that
      was then connected into long-distance brain networks. The model could 
      distinguish between 2 perceptions (oversimplification), and created
      a simple global workspace with feed-forward and feedback connections
      with multiple scales
      - The model exhibited many physiological properties seen in real 
        experiments (i.e. the signatures of CON):
        + Global ignition- when stimulated, the stimuli went moved up the 
          cortical hierarchy, causing sustained activation, and capturing the 
          essence of how the brain forms a long-lasting representation of a 
          piece of information 
        + Most simulated neurons showed a late/sudden increase in currents
          received, with excitation proceeding forward but also back to the 
          original areas that started it
        + Gamma fluctuations- the ignited states led to reverberation of 
          neuronal activity, with the net effect of an increase in oscillatory 
          fluctuations, with a peak in the gamma range
        + At the time of global ignition, spikes became coupled and synchronized
          among neurons coding for conscious representation
      MG> I'm curious as to whether Dehaene considers this model to be 
          conscious, given that it seems to exhibit the signatures of
          consciousness. (If I had to guess, I'd say Dehaene wouldn't call this
          conscious.) I wish Dehaene would state this more explicitly, and 
          say more about what an actual conscious computational model would 
          have to do, in more detail than just saying that the brain is more 
          complicated than their model.
  - The simulation showed conscious access corresponds to a phase transition
    from an ongoing state of low spontaneous activity to a temporary moment of
    elevated activity and synchronized exchanges
    + The simulation also fits well with the idea that there is a threshold
      for consciousness, delineating subliminal thoughts from conscious ones
      - Unconscious processing = neuronal activity that doesn't trigger global 
        ignition
      - CON = the sudden transition to a higher state of synchronization
  - The simulation also modeled another phase transition-the "awakening" of the 
    entire network- each pyramidal neuron received a vigilance signal 
    summarizing the effects of acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and seratonin
    + A low vigilance signal decreased spontaneous activity and the ignition 
      property disappeared, so the system behaved like a sleepy or sedated brain
    + A higher vigilance signal caused an electroencephalogram to emerge, and 
      ignition reappeared 

The Restless Brain

o Spontaneous neuronal activity also emerged in the simulation- neurons would
  spontaneously fire even in the absence of input, and at high levels of the 
  vigilance parameter, occasionaly global ignition would occur
  - Similar things occur in the real brain- stimulus evoked brain activity 
    accounts for less than 5 percent of energy consumed by the brain. Even 
    when we are asleep or think of nothing, the brain constantly produces
    neuronal activity
    MG> This is really interesting and surprising, and to me seems to emphasize
        the idea that we are less in control than we believe ourselves to be. 
        While I would definitely agree that conscious thought is not the only
        thing that our brain uses energy on, it is shocking to me that Dehaene 
        says less than 5 percent is stimulus related, although I guess not all 
        conscious stem from a stimulus.
    MG> After reading further, I've realized that indeed our conscious thoughts 
        not stemming from external stimuli would lie outside this 5 percent. 
        I do wonder how much these thoughts are influenced by such spontaneous
        activity. For instance, whenever a seemingly unrelated thought pops 
        into one's head, is this due to these spontaneos discharges?
  - Scientists have observed cortical activity and activated global networks
    in resting people
    + Spontaneous brain activity invades the neuronal workspace and can block 
      other stimuli, causing the inattentional blindness described earlier in
      the book
      - In the model, this spontaneous activity also resulted in external
        input being blocked from achieving global ignition, mimicking
        inattentional blindness and attentional blink
    + Both in the real brain and Dehaene's model, random activity can explain
      why the same stimulus sometimes can cause ignition, and sometimes causes
      just a trickle of activity
